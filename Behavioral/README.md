# Behavioral Interview Questions

#### ✅ Tell me about a situation where you had a conflict with someone on your team. What was it about? What did you do? How did they react? What was the outcome?

**Situation:**
In a previous project, there was a disagreement with a team member regarding the choice of technology stack for a critical component of our application. My colleague favored a more established technology, while I believed a newer framework would better suit our project's requirements.

**Task:**
We were tasked with developing a scalable and maintainable module that would play a pivotal role in the overall system architecture.

**Action:**
To address the conflict, I proposed organizing a meeting to discuss our viewpoints openly. During the meeting, I presented the advantages of the newer technology, emphasizing its performance, scalability, and the potential for future enhancements. I made sure to acknowledge the strengths of the established technology my colleague preferred.

**Result:**
Initially, there was some tension as we defended our respective positions. However, by maintaining a collaborative and respectful tone, we were able to find common ground. We decided to conduct a small-scale proof of concept (POC) using both technologies to evaluate their real-world performance and suitability for our project.

**Outcome:**
The POC turned out to be crucial in resolving the conflict. It provided tangible evidence and metrics that we could use to make an informed decision. After reviewing the results together, we reached a consensus to go with the newer technology. This decision not only addressed our immediate project needs but also set a precedent for the team to consider innovative solutions based on merit.

**Reflection:**
This experience taught me the importance of open communication and data-driven decision-making in resolving conflicts. It also reinforced the idea that conflicts, when managed effectively, can lead to better outcomes and stronger team cohesion. Following this incident, my colleague and I developed a better understanding of each other's perspectives, fostering a more collaborative working relationship.
