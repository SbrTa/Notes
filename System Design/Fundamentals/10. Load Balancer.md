# Load Balancer

### How does the load balancer choose the backend server?
Load balancers consider two factors to forward traffic -
  - Health check
  - Load balancing algorithm

Some of the common load balancing algorithms are:
  - DNS level load balancing
  - Round Robin: sequential or rotational manner.
  - Weighted Round Robin
  - Least Connection Method: the fewest active connections.
  - Least Response Time Method: fewest active connections and the least average response time.
  - Source IP Hash: the request is sent to the server based on the client’s IP address. The IP address of the client and the receiving compute instance are computed with a cryptographic algorithm. 

### Where to add load balancer?
We can add load balancer at three places:
  - Between the user and the web server
  - Between web servers and an internal platform layer, like application servers or cache servers
  - Between internal platform layer and database

### Is your load balancer is a single point of failure?
The load balancer can be a single point of failure. To overcome this, a second load balancer can be connected to the first to form a cluster. 
Each LB monitors the health of the other and, since both of them are equally capable of serving traffic and failure detection, in the event 
the main load balancer fails, the second load balancer takes over.


## Key Terms

### Load Balancer
A type of reverse proxy that distributes traffic across servers. Load balancers can be found in many parts of a
system, from the DNS layer all the way to the database layer.

### Server-Selection Strategy
How a load balancer chooses servers when distributing traffic amongst multiple servers. Commonly used
strategies include round-robin, random selection, performance-based selection (choosing the server with the
best performance metrics, like the fastest response time or the least amount of traffic), and IP-based routing.

### Hot Spot
When distributing a workload across a set of servers, that workload might be spread unevenly. This can
happen if your sharding key or your hashing function are suboptimal, or if your workload is naturally
skewed: some servers will receive a lot more traffic than others, thus creating a "hot spot".

### Nginx
Pronounced "engine X"—not "N jinx", Nginx is a very popular webserver that's often used as a reverse proxy
and load balancer.
