# CLient Server Model
A client is a thing that talks to servers. A server is a thing that talks to clients. The client—server model is a thing made up of a bunch of clients and servers talking to one another.

When we type github.com/.... is browser, browser doesn't recognise github. So it makes a DNS query to get IP address of github.com.
Then it makes the request using some protocol to this IP address.
  - try DNS query using your command tool: ```dig github.com```

A server usually listen for request on specific port. Any machine can have 65535 port (16-bit). The ports from 0 to 1023 are considers system ports 
and others are unassigned.So you have to specify the port. Usually protocols uses some specific ports.
  - we can use netcat tool to visualise this.
  - client: ```nc -l 8081```
  - server: ```nc 127.0.0.1 8081```
  - type anything on server terminal, you will see them in client.


## Key Terms

### Client
A machine or process that requests data or service from a server.

Note that a single machine or piece of software can be both a client and a server at the same time. For
instance, a single machine could act as a server for end users and as a client for a database.

### Server
A machine or process that provides data or service for a client, usually by listening for incoming network calls.

Note that a single machine or piece of software can be both a client and a server at the same time. For
instance, a single machine could act as a server for end users and as a client for a database.

### Client—Server Model
The paradigm by which modern systems are designed, which consists of clients requesting data or service
from servers and servers providing data or service to clients.

### IP Address
An address given to each machine connected to the public internet. IPv4 addresses consist of four numbers
separated by dots: a.b.c.d where all four numbers are between 0 and 255. Special values include:
  - 127.0.0.1: Your own local machine. Also referred to as localhost.
  - 192.168.x.y: Your private network. For instance, your machine and all machines on your private wifi
network will usually have the 192.168 prefix.

### Port
In order for multiple programs to listen for new network connections on the same machine without colliding,
they pick a port to listen on. A port is an integer between 0 and 65,535 (216 ports total).

Typically, ports 0-1023 are reserved for system ports (also called well-known ports) and shouldn't be used by
user-level processes. Certain ports have pre-defined uses, and although you usually won't be required to have
them memorized, they can sometimes come in handy. Below are some examples:
  - 22: Secure Shell
  - 53: DNS lookup
  - 80: HTTP
  - 443: HTTPS

### DNS
Short for Domain Name System, it describes the entities and protocols involved in the translation from
domain names to IP Addresses. Typically, machines make a DNS query to a well known entity which is
responsible for returning the IP address (or multiple ones) of the requested domain name in the response.
