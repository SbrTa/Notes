# CLient Server Model
Client is a machine that speaks to a server and a server is a another machine that listen to the client and then speaks back to the client.

When we type github.com/.... is browser, browser doesn't recognise github. So it makes a DNS query to get IP address of github.com.
Then it makes the request using some protocol to this IP address.
  - try DNS query using your command tool: ```dig github.com```

A server usually listen for request on specific port. Any machine can have 65535 port (16-bit). The ports from 0 to 1023 are considers system ports 
and others are unassigned.So you have to specify the port. Usually protocols uses some specific ports.
  - we can use netcat tool to visualise this.
  - client: nc -l 8081
  - server: nc 127.0.0.1 8081
  - type anything on server terminal, you will see them in client.
