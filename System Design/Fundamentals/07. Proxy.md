# Proxy
Proxy - representing someone else

A proxy server, sometimes referred to as a forward proxy, is a server that routes traffic between client(s) and server.
By doing so, it can 
  - regulate traffic according to preset policies
  - convert and mask client IP addresses
  - enforce security protocols
  - block unknown traffic

### Forward Proxy
  - seats between client and server
  - act on behalf of client
  - client sends request to froward proxy, which forwards request to server
  - servers get the request from proxy and response back to the proxy
  - normally forword proxy replace the request source as it is the original source
  - VPN works as a forward proxy in its simplified way
  - server has no idea that client and forward proxy are different entity. it sees only the proxy as a client.

### Reverse Proxy
  - seats between client and server
  - acts on behalf of server
  - when client sends request to server, the request goes to reverse proxy
  - client has no idea about proxy. client thiks it is interecting with server
  - when reverse proxy is configured correctly, DNS query returns the IP address of reverse proxy
  - client has no idea, that there are two entity, reverse proxy and server
  - client sending request by knowing that it is requesting to server
  - in a complecated system, reverse proxy is very usefull
  - reverse proxy can be used to filter certain request to ignore so that the server doesn't have to deal with such request
  - can be used to request logging
  - caching
  - athentication
  - one of the best use case of reverse proxy is using it as a load balancer


#### Example for demo
  - vscode and terminal
  - open and run server.js
  - curl localhost://3000
  - nginx -t
  - code -r nginx.config
  - nginx
  - curl localhost://8080
