# Peer-To-Peer Networks

### Peer-To-Peer Network
A collection of machines referred to as peers that divide a workload between themselves to presumably
complete the workload faster than would otherwise be possible. 
  - Often used in filedistribution systems.
  - Uses DHT (Distributed Hash Table)


### Gossip Protocol
When a set of machines talk to each other in a uncoordinated manner in a cluster to spread information
through a system without requiring a central source of data.

### Kraken (Uber)
Kraken is a P2P-powered Docker registry that focuses on scalability and availability. It is designed for Docker image management, replication, and distribution in a hybrid cloud environment. With pluggable backend support, Kraken can easily integrate into existing Docker registry setups as the distribution layer.

Kraken has been in production at Uber since early 2018. In our busiest cluster, Kraken distributes more than 1 million blobs per day, including 100k 1G+ blobs. At its peak production load, Kraken distributes 20K 100MB-1G blobs in under 30 sec.
