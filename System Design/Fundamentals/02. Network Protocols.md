# Network Protocols
  - CLient server interacts with each other using some network protocol
  - Protocols are a set of predefined rules
  - Network protocol consisits of type of messages, format of messages, order of the message, response structure
  - Some of the protocols are - IP, TCP, HTTP

### IP - Internet Protocol
  - Modern internet effectively runs following the internet protocols.
  - Data are sent in the form of IP packets.
  - Packets consists of header and data. Header contains source-destination details, information about data and packet.
  - Packets are limited in size. 2^16 bytes = 0.06MB.
  - If client sent larger data, the data is broken into multiple packets.
  - IP doesn't guarantee that all packets will be recieved by receiver. Some Packet may lost over the network.
  - IP doesn't guarantee packet order. So sent order and receiving order may be different.
  - That's where TCP comes into the picture.

### TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
  - Built on top of IP
  - Sents IP packet in order.
  - Guarantees the receiver recieves all the packet or if fails clients is acknowledged.
  - For any client server interaction, TCP first creates a TCP connection between client server.
  - TCP connection is established through handshake. 
  - If one machine doesn't sent data in a given amount of period, the connection times out.
  - If one machine want to end the connection, it sents some kind of special message to let the other machine know.
  - TCP is not a robust communication channel. Not enough easy to maintain.
  - That's where HTTP comes into picture.

### HTTP - Hyper Text Transport Protocol
  - Built on top of TCP
  - HTTP introduces request response paradigm.
  - So one machine sents request and other respond to the request.
  - So in HTTP, all we deal with request and response.
