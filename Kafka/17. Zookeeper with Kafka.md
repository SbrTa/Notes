# Zookeeper with Kafka

### What is Zookeeper in Kafka and what does Zookeeper do?
How do the Kafka brokers and clients keep track of all the Kafka brokers if there is more than one? The Kafka team decided to use Zookeeper for this purpose.

Zookeeper is used for metadata management in the Kafka world. For example:
- Zookeeper keeps track of which brokers are part of the Kafka cluster
- Zookeeper is used by Kafka brokers to determine which broker is the leader of a given partition and topic and perform leader elections
- Zookeeper stores configurations for topics and permissions
- Zookeeper sends notifications to Kafka in case of changes (e.g. new topic, broker dies, broker comes up, delete topics, etc.â€¦)

A Zookeeper cluster is called an ensemble. It is recommended to operate the ensemble with an odd number of servers, e.g., 3, 5, 7, as a strict majority of ensemble members (a quorum) must be working in order for Zookeeper to respond to requests. Zookeeper has a leader to handle writes, the rest of the servers are followers to handle reads.
