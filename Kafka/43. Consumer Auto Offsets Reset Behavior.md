# Consumer Auto Offsets Reset Behavior
A consumer is expected to read from a log continuously.

Kafka consumers have a configuration for how to behave when they donâ€™t have a previously committed offset. This can happen if the consumer application has a bug and it is down. For example, if Kafka has a retention of 7 days, and your consumer is down for more than 7 days, the offsets are "invalid" as they will be deleted.

In this case, consumers have a choice to either start reading from the beginning of the partition or from the end of the partition. This is controlled by the consumer configuration - auto.offset.reset

#### auto.offset.reset
Three possible values:
- latest (default) which means consumers will read messages from the tail of the partition
- earliest which means reading from the oldest offset in the partition
- none throw exception to the consumer if no previous offset is found for the consumer's group

#### offset.retention.minutes
The default retention period for message offsets in Kafka (version >= 2.0) is one week (7 days). It is a broker level setting. It is the offset retention period for the __consumer_offsets topic (in minutes).


## Replaying data for Consumers
It is possible to read data whose offsets are earlier than the partition commits. This may be required in unexpected circumstances to recover from errors. To replay data for a consumer group:
- Take all the consumers from a specific group down
- Use kafka-consumer-groups command to set offset to what you want (or Conduktor)
- Restart consumers

### Alternative to Using Offsets
As an alternative to using Consumer Groups and offsets, you can manually read from topics using your own strategy using the lower level API such as .seek() and .assign()
