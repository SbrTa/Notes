# Delivery Semantics for Kafka Consumers

A consumer reading from a Kafka partition may choose when to commit offsets. That strategy impacts the behaviors if messages are skipped or read twice upon a consumer restart. These behaviors are discussed on this page.

## At Most Once Delivery
In this case, offsets are committed as soon as a message batch is received after calling poll(). If the subsequent processing fails, the message will be lost. It will not be read again as the offsets of those messages have been committed already. This may be suitable for systems that can afford to lose data.

## At Least Once Delivery (usually preferred)
In at-least-once delivery, every event from the source system will reach its destination, but sometimes retries will cause duplicates. Here, offsets are committed after the message is processed. If the processing goes wrong, the message will be read again. This can result in duplicate processing of messages. This is suitable for consumers that cannot afford any data loss.

## Exactly Once Delivery
Some applications require not just at-least-once semantics (meaning no data loss), but also exactly-once semantics. Each message is delivered exactly once. This may be achieved in certain situations if Kafka and the consumer application cooperate to make exactly-once semantics happen.

This can only be achieved for Kafka topic to Kafka topic workflows using the transactions API. The Kafka Streams API simplifies the usage of that API and enables exactly once using the setting processing.guarantee=exactly.once

For Kafka topic to External System workflows, to effectively achieve exactly once, you must use an idempotent consumer.


## Summary
- At most once: offsets are committed as soon as the message is received. If the processing goes wrong, the message will be lost (it won’t be read again).- 
- At least once: offsets are committed after the message is processed. If the processing goes wrong, the message will be read again. This can result in duplicate processing of messages. Make sure your processing is idempotent (i.e. processing again the messages won’t impact your systems)
- Exactly once: Can be achieved for Kafka => Kafka workflows using high-level Kafka Streams API, or the lower level Kafka Transactions API. For Kafka => Sink workflows, use an idempotent consumer.
