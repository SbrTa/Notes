# Kafka Producers
Applications that send data into topics are known as Kafka producers. Applications typically integrate a Kafka client library to write to Apache Kafka. Excellent client libraries exist for almost all programming languages that are popular today including Python, Java, Go, and others.

A Kafka producer sends messages to a topic, and messages are distributed to partitions according to a mechanism such as key hashing.

### Message Keys
Each event message contains an optional key and a value.

In case the key (key=null) is not specified by the producer, messages are distributed evenly across partitions in a topic. This means messages are sent in a round-robin fashion (partition p0 then p1 then p2, etc... then back to p0 and so on...).

If a key is sent (key != null), then all messages that share the same key will always be sent and stored in the same Kafka partition. A key can be anything to identify a message - a string, numeric value, binary value, etc.

Kafka message keys are commonly used when there is a need for message ordering for all messages sharing the same field. For example, in the scenario of tracking trucks in a fleet, we want data from trucks to be in order at the individual truck level. In that case, we can choose the key to be truck_id. In the example shown below, the data from the truck with id truck_id_123 will always go to partition p0.

### Kafka Message Anatomy
Kafka messages are created by the producer. A Kafka message consists of the following elements:

- Key. Key is optional in the Kafka message and it can be null. A key may be a string, number, or any object and then the key is serialized into binary format.
- Value. The value represents the content of the message and can also be null. The value format is arbitrary and is then also serialized into binary format.
- Compression Type. Kafka messages may be compressed. The compression type can be specified as part of the message. Options are none, gzip, lz4, snappy, and zstd
- Headers. There can be a list of optional Kafka message headers in the form of key-value pairs. It is common to add headers to specify metadata about the message, especially for tracing.
- Partition + Offset. Once a message is sent into a Kafka topic, it receives a partition number and an offset id. The combination of topic+partition+offset uniquely identifies the message
- Timestamp. A timestamp is added either by the user or the system in the message.


### Kafka Message Serializers
In many programming languages, the key and value are represented as objects, which greatly increases the code readability. However, Kafka brokers expect byte arrays as keys and values of messages. The process of transforming the producer's programmatic representation of the object to binary is called message serialization.

As shown below, we have a message with an Integer key and a String value. Since the key is an integer, we have to use an IntegerSerializer to convert it into a byte array. For the value, since it is a string, we must leverage a StringSerializer.
