# Kafka Topic Replication
One of the main reasons for Kafka's popularity, is the resilience it offers in the face of broker failures. Machines fail, and often we cannot predict when that is going to happen or prevent it. Kafka is designed with replication as a core feature to withstand these failures while maintaining uptime and data accuracy.

### Kafka Topic Replication Factor
In Kafka, replication means that data is written down not just to one broker, but many.

The replication factor is a topic setting and is specified at topic creation time.
- A replication factor of 1 means no replication. It is mostly used for development purposes and should be avoided in test and production Kafka clusters
- A replication factor of 3 is a commonly used replication factor as it provides the right balance between broker loss and replication overhead.

### What are Kafka Partitions Leader and Replicas?
For a given topic-partition, one Kafka broker is designated by the cluster to be responsible for sending and receiving data to clients. That broker is known as the leader broker of that topic partition. Any other broker that is storing replicated data for that partition is referred to as a replica.

Therefore, each partition has one leader and multiple replicas.

### What are In-Sync Replicas (ISR)?
An ISR is a replica that is up to date with the leader broker for a partition. Any replica that is not up to date with the leader is out of sync.

Here we have Broker 101 as Partition 0 leader and Broker 102 as the leader of Partition 1. Broker 102 is a replica for Partition 0 and Broker 103 is a replica for Partition 1. If the leader broker were to fail, one of the replicas will be elected as the new partition leader by an election.
