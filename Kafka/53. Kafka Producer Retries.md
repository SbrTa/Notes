# Kafka Producer Retries
When the producer sends messages to a broker, the broker can return either a success or an error code. Those error codes belong to two categories.

Retriable errors:
Errors that can be resolved after retrying. For example, if the broker returns the exception NotEnoughReplicasException, the producer can try sending the message again - maybe replica brokers will come back online and the second attempt will succeed.

Nonretriable error:
Errors that won’t be resolved. For example, if the broker returns an INVALID_CONFIG exception, trying the same producer request again will not change the outcome of the request.

It is desirable to enable retries in order to ensure that no messages are dropped when sent to Apache Kafka.

## Producer Retry Configurations

### retries
The retries setting determines how many times the producer will attempt to send a message before marking it as failed. The default values are:
- 0 for Kafka <= 2.0
- MAX_INT, i.e., 2147483647 for Kafka >= 2.1

Users should generally prefer to leave this config unset and instead use delivery.timeout.ms to control retry behavior.

### delivery.timeout.ms
If retries > 0, for example, retries = 2147483647, the producer won’t try the request forever, it’s bounded by a timeout. For this, you can set an intuitive Producer Timeout (KIP-91 – Kafka 2.1) such as delivery.timeout.ms=120000 (= 2 minutes). Records will be failed if they can’t be delivered in delivery.timeout.ms


### retry.backoff.ms
By default, the producer will wait 100ms between retries, but you can control this using the retry.backoff.ms parameter.

### max.in.flight.requests.per.connection
Allowing retries without setting max.in.flight.requests.per.connection to 1 will potentially change the ordering of records because if two batches are sent to a single partition, and the first fails and is retried but the second succeeds, then the records in the second batch may appear first. If you rely on key-based ordering, that can be an issue. By limiting the number of in-flight requests to 1 (default being 5), i.e., max.in.flight.requests.per.connection = 1, we can guarantee that Kafka will preserve message order in the event that some messages will require multiple retries before they are successfully acknowledged.


VERY important: if we enable idempotence enable=idempotence=true, then it is required for max.in.flight.requests.per.connection to be less than or equal to 5 with message ordering preserved for any allowable value!!
