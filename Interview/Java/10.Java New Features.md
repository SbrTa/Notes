# Java New Features


#### ✅ Java 8
  - **Lambda expressions** are an anonymous, classless function.
  - **Method references** are shorthand notations of lambda expressions used to call methods.
  - **Functional interfaces** are interfaces with a single abstract method.
  - **Default methods** enabled backward compatibility by allowing developers to add new methods to an interface without needing to modify the implementation class.
  - Static methods belong only to the interface, so implementation of this method can only be written in the interface itself.
  - **Stream APIs** are used to perform aggregate operations on elements returned from various data sources (such as collections or arrays).
  - **Date-Time APIs improved** on the old design by making them more readable, and easier to use with differing time zones.
