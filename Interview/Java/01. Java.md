# Java Interview Question

#### ✅ Is Java purely object-oriented language?
Java is not a fully object-oriented language as it supports primitive data types like int, byte, long, short, etc., which are not objects. Only **Smalltalk** and **Self** are recognised as purely object-oriented languages.


#### ✅ JDK vs JRE vs JVM
  - **JDK**:
    - Java Development Kit aka JDK
    - Provides all the tools, executables, and binaries required to compile, debug, and execute a Java Program.
    - JDK is a platform-specific software and that’s why we have separate installers for Windows, Mac, and Unix systems.
    - JDK is the superset of JRE since it contains JRE with Java compiler, debugger, and core classes.
  
  - **JRE**:
    - JRE is the implementation of JVM.
    - Provides a platform to execute java programs.
    - JRE consists of JVM, Java binaries, and other classes to execute any program successfully.
    - JRE doesn’t contain any development tools such as Java compiler, debugger, JShell, etc.
    - If you just want to execute a java program, you can install only JRE. You don’t need JDK because there is no development or compilation of java source code is required.
  
  - **JVM**:
    - When we execute a Java program, JVM is responsible for converting the byte code to the machine-specific code.
    - JVM is also platform-dependent
    - Provides core java functions such as memory management, garbage collection, security, etc.
    - JVM is customizable and we can use java options to customize it. For example, allocating minimum and maximum memory to JVM.
    - JVM is called virtual because it provides an interface that does not depend on the underlying operating system and machine hardware. This independence from hardware and the operating system makes java program write-once-run-anywhere.

#### ✅ Some popular openJDK
  - **Adoptium Eclipse Temurin**: Adoptium Eclipse Temurin OpenJDK builds are highly recommended.
  - **Amazon Corretto**: Corretto builds are a good choice, particularly if you run Java applications directly on Amazon Linux 2 in AWS.
  - **Azul Zulu**: Azul Zulu Builds of OpenJDK are a good choice.
  - **BellSoft Liberica JDK**: BellSoft Liberica JDK builds are a good choice. The popular Spring Boot framework chose Liberica JDK as runtime for their buildpack.
  - **Microsoft Build of OpenJDK**: Use Microsoft Build of OpenJDK, only if you run Java applications directly on Azure. There are more established options available.

#### ✅ ClassLoader in Java
The Java ClassLoader is a part of the Java Runtime Environment that dynamically loads Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine. The Java run time system does not need to know about files and file systems because of classloaders. Java classes aren’t loaded into memory all at once, but when required by an application. At this point, the Java ClassLoader is called by the JRE and these ClassLoaders load classes into memory dynamically.
  - **Bootstrap ClassLoader**: Java classes are loaded by an instance of java.lang.ClassLoader. However, class loaders are classes themselves. So the question is, who loads the java.lang.ClassLoader itself? This is where the bootstrap or primordial class loader comes into play. It’s mainly responsible for loading JDK internal classes, typically rt.jar and other core libraries located in the $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib directory. Additionally, the Bootstrap class loader serves as the parent of all the other ClassLoader instances. This bootstrap class loader is part of the core JVM and is written in native code.
  - **Extension ClassLoader**: The extension class loader is a child of the bootstrap class loader, and takes care of loading the extensions of the standard core Java classes so that they’re available to all applications running on the platform. The extension class loader loads from the JDK extensions directory, usually the $JAVA_HOME/lib/ext directory, or any other directory mentioned in the java.ext.dirs system property.
  - **System ClassLoader**: The system or application class loader, on the other hand, takes care of loading all the application level classes into the JVM. It loads files found in the classpath environment variable, -classpath, or -cp command line option. It’s also a child of the extensions class loader.


#### ✅ Principles of functionality of a Java ClassLoader
Principles of functionality are the set of rules or features on which a Java ClassLoader works. There are three principles of functionality, they are:
  - **Delegation Model**: The Java Virtual Machine and the Java ClassLoader use an algorithm called the Delegation Hierarchy Algorithm to Load the classes into the Java file. The ClassLoader works based on a set of operations given by the delegation model. They are:
    - ClassLoader always follows the Delegation Hierarchy Principle.
    - Whenever JVM comes across a class, it checks whether that class is already loaded or not.
    - If the Class is already loaded in the method area then the JVM proceeds with execution.
    - If the class is not present in the method area then the JVM asks the Java ClassLoader Sub-System to load that particular class, then ClassLoader sub-system hands over the control to Application ClassLoader.
    - Application ClassLoader then delegates the request to Extension ClassLoader and the Extension ClassLoader in turn delegates the request to Bootstrap ClassLoader.
    - Bootstrap ClassLoader will search in the Bootstrap classpath(JDK/JRE/LIB). If the class is available then it is loaded, if not the request is delegated to Extension ClassLoader.
    - Extension ClassLoader searches for the class in the Extension Classpath(JDK/JRE/LIB/EXT). If the class is available then it is loaded, if not the request is delegated to the Application ClassLoader.
    - Application ClassLoader searches for the class in the Application Classpath. If the class is available then it is loaded, if not then a ClassNotFoundException exception is generated.
  - **Visibility Principle**: The Visibility Principle states that a class loaded by a parent ClassLoader is visible to the child ClassLoaders but a class loaded by a child ClassLoader is not visible to the parent ClassLoaders. Suppose a class GEEKS.class has been loaded by the Extension ClassLoader, then that class is only visible to the Extension ClassLoader and Application ClassLoader but not to the Bootstrap ClassLoader. If that class is again tried to load using Bootstrap ClassLoader it gives an exception java.lang.ClassNotFoundException.
  - **Uniqueness Property**: The Uniqueness Property ensures that the classes are unique and there is no repetition of classes. This also ensures that the classes loaded by parent classloaders are not loaded by the child classloaders. If the parent class loader isn’t able to find the class, only then the current instance would attempt to do so itself.

#### ✅ What's the difference between thread and process?
**A process is a self contained execution environment** and it can be seen as a program or application whereas **Thread is a single task** of execution within the process. Java runtime environment runs as a single process which contains different classes and programs as processes. Thread can be called lightweight process. Thread requires less resources to create and exists in the process, thread shares the process resources.

#### ✅ What are the two ways of implementing thread in Java?
  - Extending the Thread class
  - Implementing Runnable interface in Java


#### ✅ User thread vs Daemon Thread
  - **User thread**
    - Exucute forground logic of application
    - These threads are normally created by the user for executing tasks concurrently. 	
    - JVM waits for user threads to finish their tasks before termination. 	
  - **Daemon Thread**
    - Invisible, hidden, service, support thread
    - Created by JVM to provides service to user thread
    - When all user thread execution ends, JVM forcefully stops all daemon thread
    - We can create daemon threads in java using the thread class **setDaemon(true)**. **isDaemon()** method is generally used to check whether the current thread is daemon or not.
    - But one can only call the setDaemon() method before start() method otherwise it will definitely throw IllegalThreadStateException.

#### ✅ What is Executors Framework?
  - Also called **multi-threading** framework.
  - This Executor Framework in Java provides a high-level abstraction that simplifies the process of creating and managing threads in a Java program. It provides a set of classes and interfaces which enables the java developers in creating and managing the thread pools.
  - The executor framework is an implementation of the **Producer-Consumer pattern**.
  - Creation of thread requires resource allocation and free up the resource when done. Managing thread life-cycle is costly.
  - Executors Framework creates a pool of threads and reuse those threads.
  - Executor manages those threads. If some threads dies, it creates it.
  - When a task comes, it has been assigned a thread from pool and when done, the thread has been put back to pool.
  - Types of Executor
    - **SingleThreadExecutor**: One threaded. Task are served ony by one.
    - **FixedThreadPool(n)**: Creates n threads at the begining and reuse them
    - **CachedThreadPool**: When a new task comes at a time when all the threads are busy in executing some other tasks, a new thread creates by the pool and add to the executor. When a thread becomes free, it carries out the execution of the new tasks. Threads are terminated and removed from the cached when they remain idle for 60s.
    - **ScheduledExecutor**: Used when we have a task that needs to be run at regular intervals or if we wish to delay a certain task.
  - EG
    ```
      ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n);
      service.submit(TASK 1);
      service.submit(TASK 2);
      service.submit(TASK x);
      service.shutdown();
    ```
