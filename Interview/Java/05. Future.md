#### ✅ Parallel and Concurrent Processing in Java
Parallel processing is the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks, while concurrent processing is the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks that may interact with each other. Java provides several classes and interfaces in the java.util.concurrent package to support parallel and concurrent processing.

#### ✅ Executor vs ForkJoinPool

ExecutorService is a general-purpose executor that can be used to execute any type of task. It provides a flexible and easy-to-use API for executing tasks asynchronously. ForkJoinPool is a specialized executor that is designed specifically for executing tasks that can be split into smaller subtasks.

ForkJoinPool uses a work-stealing pattern, which means one thread can also execute a pending task from another thread. This improves efficiency in the case of ForkJoinTask as most of the ForkJoinTask algorithm spawn new tasks. ForkJoinPool extends AbstractExecutorService, which implements ExecutorService interface. 

#### ✅ Future
- Future is an interface 
- Belongs to java.util.concurrent package.
- Java 1.5
- It is used to represent the result of an asynchronous computation.
- used for storing a result received from a different thread
- The interface provides the methods to check if the computation is completed or not, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of the computation.
- Methods - cancel(), isCancelled(), isDone(), get()
- The cancel() method is used to stop the task if it has not started. If the task has started and the mayInterrupt boolean value is true, it will interrupt that task too.
- The get() method returns the result of the task. It returns the result immediately if the task is completed; else, it will wait for its completion and then returns the result.
- 
```
    ExecutorService es = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();  

    //getting future  
    //the method submit() submits a value-returning task for execution and returns the Future  
    Future<String> future = es.submit(() ->   {  
        //sleep thread for 2 seconds      
        Thread.sleep(2000);  
        return "Welcome to Javatpoint";  
    });  

    //checks if the task is completed or not  
    while(!future.isDone()) {  
        System.out.println("The task is still in process.....");  
        Thread.sleep(200);  
    }  

    System.out.println("Task completed! getting the result");  
    //getting the result after completing the task  
    String result = future.get();  
    //prints the result   
    System.out.println(result);  
    es.shutdown();  
```
#### ✅ FutureTask
- A class in java.util.concurrent package
- Implements Runnable and Future interface

#### ✅ Completatble Future
- CompletableFuture is a class
- java.util.concurrent
- implements the **Future** and **CompletionStage** Interface
- since java 1.8
- It represents a future result of an **asynchronous computation**.
- used for storing a result received from a different thread
- It can be thought of as a container that holds the result of an asynchronous operation that is being executed in a different thread. It provides a number of methods to perform various operations on the result of the async computation.


#### ✅ Completable Future Methods

```

    /**
     * Returns a new CompletableFuture that is asynchronously completed
     * by a task running in the {@link ForkJoinPool#commonPool()} with
     * the value obtained by calling the given Supplier.
     *
     * @param supplier a function returning the value to be used
     * to complete the returned CompletableFuture
     * @param <U> the function's return type
     * @return the new CompletableFuture
     */
    public static <U> CompletableFuture<U> supplyAsync(Supplier<U> supplier) {
        return asyncSupplyStage(asyncPool, supplier);
    }

    /**
     * Returns a new CompletableFuture that is asynchronously completed
     * by a task running in the given executor with the value obtained
     * by calling the given Supplier.
     *
     * @param supplier a function returning the value to be used

     * @param executor the executor to use for asynchronous execution
     * @param <U> the function's return type
     * @return the new CompletableFuture
     */
    public static <U> CompletableFuture<U> supplyAsync(Supplier<U> supplier,
                                                       Executor executor) {
        return asyncSupplyStage(screenExecutor(executor), supplier);
    }

    /**
     * Returns a new CompletableFuture that is asynchronously completed
     * by a task running in the {@link ForkJoinPool#commonPool()} after
     * it runs the given action.
     *
     * @param runnable the action to run before completing the
     * returned CompletableFuture
     * @return the new CompletableFuture
     */
    public static CompletableFuture<Void> runAsync(Runnable runnable) {
        return asyncRunStage(asyncPool, runnable);
    }

    /**
     * Returns a new CompletableFuture that is asynchronously completed
     * by a task running in the given executor after it runs the given
     * action.
     *
     * @param runnable the action to run before completing the
     * returned CompletableFuture
     * @param executor the executor to use for asynchronous execution
     * @return the new CompletableFuture
     */
    public static CompletableFuture<Void> runAsync(Runnable runnable,
                                                   Executor executor) {
        return asyncRunStage(screenExecutor(executor), runnable);
    }
```

#### ✅ Handle errors — CompletableFuture

CompletableFuture provides a number of methods for handling errors that can occur during asynchronous operations. 
```
        CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            int result = 10 / 0; // Causes an ArithmeticException
            return result;
        });
        
        future.exceptionally(ex -> {
            System.out.println("Exception occurred: " + ex.getMessage());
            return 0; // Default value to return if there's an exception
        }).thenAccept(result -> {
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        });
```

In this example, we’re creating a CompletableFuture that will throw an ArithmeticException because we're dividing by zero. We're then calling the exceptionally() method to specify what to do if there's an exception. In this case, we're printing an error message to the console and returning a default value of 0.

We’re then calling the thenAccept() method to specify what to do when the operation is complete, whether there was an exception or not. In this case, we're simply printing the result to the console.

When we run this code, it will print “Exception occurred: / by zero” to the console followed by “Result: 0”.

#### ✅ Future vs CompletableFuture

**Blocking vs non-blocking:** Future is a blocking API, whereas CompletableFuture is non-blocking. With a Future object, you must call the get() method to retrieve the result, but this method blocks until the result is available. In contrast, with a CompletableFuture object, you can use various non-blocking methods to retrieve the result, such as thenApply(), thenAccept(), or join().

**Composition:** CompletableFuture provides a more powerful composition API than Future. With Future, it is difficult to chain multiple asynchronous operations together or to combine the results of multiple operations. CompletableFuture, on the other hand, provides methods such as thenCompose(), thenCombine(), and allOf() that make it easy to compose multiple asynchronous operations and to handle their results in a non-blocking way.

**Exception Handling:** CompletableFuture provides better exception handling than Future. With Future, you can only check if the computation completed successfully or not. If an exception occurs during the computation, you have to catch it explicitly. In contrast, with CompletableFuture, you can handle exceptions in a more declarative way using methods like exceptionally() and handle().\

**Completion:** With a Future object, there is no way to explicitly complete the future. Once you submit a task to an executor service and get a Future object in return, you can only wait for the task to complete. With CompletableFuture, you have more control over the completion of the future. You can complete it explicitly by calling complete(), completeExceptionally(), or cancel() methods.


#### ✅ Runnable vs Callable
The Java Callable interface, java.util.concurrent.Callable, represents an asynchronous task which can be executed by a separate thread. For instance, it is possible to submit a Callable object to a Java ExecutorService which will then execute it asynchronously.

There is a drawback of creating a thread with the Runnable interface, i.e., we cannot make a thread return result when it terminates, i.e., when the run() completes. In order to overcome this drawback, Java provides the Callable interface.

Differences between Callable and Runnable
- The call() method of Callable can return a value, while the run() method of Runnable cannot return a value.
- When working with Callable, you can use mechanisms like Future or FutureTask to obtain the result when the task is completed. Runnable does not provide such a mechanism directly.
- Callable can specify checked exceptions (e.g., Exception) when throwing exceptions, while Runnable cannot throw checked exceptions.
- Callable returns a result when the thread's work is completed, while Runnable only completes the work, requiring a separate mechanism to transmit the result.

#### ✅ BlockingQueue
BlockingQueue interface supports flow control (in addition to queue) by introducing blocking if either BlockingQueue is full or empty. A thread trying to insert an element in a full queue is blocked until some other thread makes space in the queue. Similarly, it blocks a thread trying to get from an empty queue until some other threads insert an item. BlockingQueue does not accept a null value.

Implementaions:
- ArrayBlockingQueue: Uses array
- DelayQueue: The DelayQueue blocks the elements internally until a certain delay has expired.
- LinkedBlockingQueue: uses linked node
- PriorityBlockingQueue: uses priority queue
- SynchronousQueue: A thread inserting an element into the queue is blocked until another thread takes that element from the queue.

BlockingDeque: uses double ended queue


#### ✅ AtomicInteger
If you will run above program, you will notice that count value varies between 5,6,7,8. The reason is because count++ is not an atomic operation. So by the time one threads read it’s value and increment it by one, other thread has read the older value leading to wrong result. To solve this issue, we will have to make sure that increment operation on count is atomic, we can do that using Synchronization but Java 5 java.util.concurrent.atomic provides wrapper classes for int and long that can be used to achieve this atomic operation without usage of Synchronization.

```
package com.journaldev.concurrency;

public class JavaAtomic {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

        ProcessingThread pt = new ProcessingThread();
        Thread t1 = new Thread(pt, "t1");
        t1.start();
        Thread t2 = new Thread(pt, "t2");
        t2.start();
        t1.join();
        t2.join();
        System.out.println("Processing count=" + pt.getCount());
    }

}

class ProcessingThread implements Runnable {
    private int count;
    // private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger();
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
            processSomething(i);
            count++;
            // count.incrementAndGet();
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return this.count;
    }

    private void processSomething(int i) {
        // processing some job
        try {
            Thread.sleep(i * 1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
```
