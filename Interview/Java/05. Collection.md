# Java Collections Framework
The Java collections framework provides a set of interfaces and classes to implement various data structures and algorithms. The Java collections framework provides various interfaces. These interfaces include several methods to perform different operations on collections.

The two root interfaces of java collection class are:
- Collection interface(java.util.collection)
- Map interface(java.util.Map)

### ArrayList
- Internally uses a dynamic array for storage.
- New arrays are created with a larger size (usually 1.5 times the original) when the capacity is reached.
- The `ensureCapacity` method is used to preemptively increase the capacity.

### LinkedList
- Uses a doubly-linked list with each node containing data and references to the next and previous nodes.
- Efficient for insertion and deletion operations.
- No random access; traversal is necessary to access elements.

### Vector
- Similar to ArrayList but with synchronized methods.
- Uses an array as the underlying data structure.
- Synchronization achieved by locking the entire object, impacting performance in highly concurrent scenarios.

### Stack
- Extends Vector and uses its underlying array.
- Provides methods for push and pop operations
- Folllows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

### HashSet
- Uses hash table to store elements.
- Hash codes determine the index where elements are stored in the array.
- Collisions handled using separate chaining (linked lists) or, starting from Java 8, balanced trees.

### LinkedHashSet
- Uses a hash table for fast access.
- Utilizes a linked list to maintain the order of insertion.
- No duplicate elements are allowed; attempting to add duplicates has no effect.

### TreeSet
- Internally uses a Red-Black tree, a self-balancing binary search tree.
- Elements stored in the tree according to natural order or a custom comparator.
- Efficient operations for finding floor, ceiling, lower, and higher elements.

### ProprityQueue
- Implements a priority queue based on a priority heap.
- Elements are ordered based on their natural ordering or by a comparator provided at the time of construction.
- No guarantee of order based on the sequence of insertion.
- Does not allow null elements.
- Offers logarithmic time for insertion and removal operations.

### ArrayDeque
- Implements a resizable, double-ended queue based on an array.
- Allows null elements.
- Offers constant-time performance for adding or removing elements from both ends of the deque.

### Hashtable
- Utilizes a hash table with an array of linked lists.
- All methods are synchronized, ensuring thread safety but potentially impacting performance.

### HashMap
- Utilizes a hash table with an array of buckets.
- Buckets may be linked lists or, starting from Java 8, balanced trees for improved performance.
- Resizes the array and rehashes elements when the load factor is exceeded.

### LinkedHashMap
- Uses a hash table for fast access to key-value pairs.
- Utilizes a doubly-linked list to maintain the order of insertion or access.
- Supports null values and allows one null key.

### TreeMap
- Internally uses a Red-Black tree, similar to TreeSet.
- Keys stored in the tree, and elements associated with the keys.
- Efficient operations for finding first and last key.

### ConcurrentHashMap
- Utilizes a hash table with the concept of segments.
- Achieves high concurrency by allowing multiple threads to operate on different segments simultaneously.
- Supports non-blocking reads and updates, reducing contention.

| **Overview**           | Uses a hash table for efficient storage and retrieval. Provides constant-time performance on average. Does not guarantee order. | Extends `HashMap`. Maintains the order of insertion; iteration order is the order in which elements were added. Optionally maintains order based on access. | A legacy class similar to `HashMap`, but is synchronized. All methods are synchronized, making it thread-safe. | Implements `NavigableMap` using a Red-Black tree. Stores keys in sorted order (natural order or a custom comparator). | Provides a high-performance alternative to `Hashtable` for concurrent applications. Uses a partitioned table structure to allow multiple threads to operate on different segments simultaneously. Supports high-concurrency reads and writes with reduced contention. |
| **Null Handling**      | Allows one null key and multiple null values.                      | Allows one null key and multiple null values.                      | Does not allow null keys or values.                                | Does not allow null keys.                                          | Does not allow null keys or values.                                |
| **Collision Handling** | Uses separate chaining to handle hash code collisions.              | Uses separate chaining to handle hash code collisions.              | Uses separate chaining to handle hash code collisions.              | Uses a Red-Black tree for efficient sorting.                      | Uses a partitioned table structure for concurrency control.       |
| **Use Cases**          | General-purpose key-value storage where order is not critical.     | When order of insertion or access is important. Useful for LRU caches. | Legacy codebases or situations where thread safety is critical.   | When a sorted order of keys is required. Suitable for range queries. | High-concurrency scenarios with frequent read and write operations. |
