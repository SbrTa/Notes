# Event Driven Architecture (EDA) Interview Questions

#### ✅ What is the definition of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)?

Answer: Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) emphasizes the production, detection, consumption, and reaction to events, enabling asynchronous communication between decoupled components.

#### ✅ How does EDA differ from traditional request-response architectures?

Answer: EDA facilitates asynchronous communication through events, promoting loose coupling, while traditional architectures rely on synchronous request-response, leading to tight coupling.

#### ✅ Explain the concept of events in the context of software architecture.

Answer: Events in software architecture represent significant occurrences or state changes, carrying information about what happened, such as user registration or order placement.

#### ✅ What are the key benefits of using EDA in a distributed system?

Answer:
  - Scalability: Allows independent scaling of components.
  - Flexibility: Enables the addition or removal of components without impacting others.
  - Resilience: Prevents system-wide failures through fault isolation.
  - Real-time Responsiveness: Components react immediately to relevant events.

#### ✅ How does EDA promote loose coupling between system components?

Answer: EDA achieves loose coupling as components communicate through events without direct dependencies, allowing for independent and asynchronous interactions.

#### ✅ Can you provide an example of a real-world scenario where EDA would be advantageous?

Answer:
In an e-commerce system, the "Order Placed" event triggers the payment service asynchronously, allowing for the addition of new services without modifying the order processing logic.

#### ✅ Discuss the challenges associated with implementing and maintaining an Event-Driven Architecture.

Answer:
  - Event Ordering: Ensuring correct event sequence.
  - Debugging: Complexity in debugging due to asynchronous nature.
  - Event Schema Evolution: Handling changes in event structures.
  - Complexity: Managing event flow in large systems.

#### ✅ What is the role of publishers and subscribers in EDA?

Answer:
  - Publishers: Emit events when specific conditions are met (e.g., Order service publishing "Order Placed" events).
  - Subscribers: Listen for specific events and take appropriate actions (e.g., Payment service subscribing to "Order Placed" events).

#### ✅ How does EDA contribute to system scalability?

Answer: EDA facilitates scalability by allowing independent scaling of components, permitting the addition of new components without impacting existing ones, and supporting horizontal scaling for handling high loads.

#### ✅ Explain the concept of event channels or message brokers in EDA.

Answer:
Middleware like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ facilitates event communication, decoupling publishers and subscribers and ensuring reliable and asynchronous event delivery.
