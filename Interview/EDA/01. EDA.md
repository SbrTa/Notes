# Event Driven Architecture (EDA) Interview Questions

#### ✅ What is the definition of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)?

Answer: EDA is a software design pattern that centers on the production, detection, consumption, and reaction to events. Events represent significant occurrences or state changes, enabling asynchronous communication between loosely coupled components. In essence, it allows systems to respond dynamically to events without relying on direct, synchronous interactions.

#### ✅ How does EDA differ from traditional request-response architectures?

Answer: Traditional architectures rely on synchronous request-response mechanisms, where a client sends a request to a server and waits for a response. In contrast, EDA decouples components by facilitating communication through events. Components in EDA act independently, reacting to events asynchronously without direct dependencies, leading to a more flexible and scalable architecture.

#### ✅ Explain the concept of events in the context of software architecture.

Answer: Events are markers of significant occurrences or state changes within a system. They carry information about what happened, allowing components to react accordingly. For instance, in a financial application, an event could be "TransactionCompleted," triggering actions like updating account balances or generating notifications.

#### ✅ What are the key benefits of using EDA in a distributed system?

Answer:
  - Scalability: Allows independent scaling of components.
  - Flexibility: Enables the addition or removal of components without impacting others.
  - Resilience: Prevents system-wide failures through fault isolation.
  - Real-time Responsiveness: Components react immediately to relevant events.

#### ✅ How does EDA promote loose coupling between system components?

Answer: EDA promotes loose coupling by allowing components to communicate through events without establishing direct dependencies. Components publish events, and others subscribe to the events they are interested in. This decouples the producers and consumers, allowing for system flexibility and easier maintenance.

#### ✅ Can you provide an example of a real-world scenario where EDA would be advantageous?

Answer: In an e-commerce system, when a customer places an order, an "OrderPlaced" event is emitted. The inventory management service, acting as a subscriber, can then asynchronously update the available stock. This allows for scalability, as other services can subscribe to the same event without impacting the order processing flow.

#### ✅ Discuss the challenges associated with implementing and maintaining an Event-Driven Architecture.

Answer:
  - Event Ordering: Ensuring correct event sequence.
  - Debugging: Complexity in debugging due to asynchronous nature.
  - Event Schema Evolution: Handling changes in event structures.
  - Complexity: Managing event flow in large systems.

#### ✅ Difference between Kafka and RabbitMQ

Message Brokering:
- Kafka is designed around a publish-subscribe model where producers publish messages to topics, and consumers subscribe to those topics to receive messages.
- RabbitMQ supports both point-to-point and publish-subscribe messaging patterns. It acts as a message broker that routes messages from producers to consumers.

Messaging Patterns:
- Kafka: Primarily supports publish-subscribe patterns. Events are broadcasted to all subscribers, allowing for real-time data streaming and analytics.
- RabbitMQ: Supports both point-to-point and publish-subscribe patterns. Point-to-point involves a single consumer receiving a message, while publish-subscribe allows messages to be broadcasted to multiple consumers.

Pull/Push:
- Kafka is pull-based. A pull-based system waits for consumers to ask for data.
- RabbitMQ is push-based. A push-based system automatically sends or “pushes” messages to subscribed consumers. 

Broker/Consumer Mode:
- Kafka’s mode is dumb broker/smart consumer.
- RabbitMQ mode is smart broker/dumb consumer. 

Message size:
- Kafka has a default of 1 MB limit.
- RabbitMQ has no constraints on payload size.

Message priority:
- Kafka: FIFO. No priority
- RabbitMQ: You can set message priorities in RabbitMQ and consume messages in the order of highest priority.

Use Cases:
- Kafka: Stream Processing and Real-time Analytics: Kafka is well-suited for stream processing, real-time analytics, log aggregation, and building data pipelines.
- RabbitMQ: General Messaging and Task Distribution: RabbitMQ is commonly used for general messaging, task distribution, and implementing Remote Procedure Call (RPC) patterns.
