# Apache Kafka Interview Questions

#### ✅ What is Apache Kafka, and how does it fit into an event-driven architecture?

Answer: Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that is widely used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It fits into an event-driven architecture by serving as a highly scalable, durable, and fault-tolerant event streaming system. Kafka allows the asynchronous communication of events between different components of a system.

#### ✅ Describe the core components of Kafka and their functions.

Answer:
  - Producer: Publishes events (messages) to Kafka topics.
  - Broker: Kafka server responsible for handling incoming events and managing storage.
  - Topic: A category or feed name to which messages are published.
  - Partition: A unit of parallelism and scalability for Kafka topics.
  - Consumer: Subscribes to topics, processes messages, and maintains offsets.

#### ✅ How does Kafka ensure fault tolerance and high availability?

Answer:
  - Replication: Kafka replicates data across multiple brokers.
  - In-Sync Replicas (ISRs): Ensures that replicas are in sync before considering data committed.
  - Leader-Follower Model: One broker is the leader for a partition, others are followers.
  - Automatic Leader Election: If a leader fails, Kafka automatically elects a new leader from the ISR.

#### ✅ Explain the role of topics and partitions in Kafka.

Answer:
  - Topic: A category to which messages are published. It represents a stream of records.
  - Partition: Divides a topic into smaller, ordered units for parallel processing and scalability. Each partition is replicated across multiple brokers for fault tolerance.

#### ✅ What is the purpose of Kafka Producers, and how do they work?

Answer:
Purpose:
  - Producers publish messages to Kafka topics.

Working:
  - Producers send messages to a specified topic.
  - Messages are assigned to partitions based on a partitioning strategy.
  - Producers can choose to receive acknowledgment of message delivery.

#### ✅ How do Kafka Consumers subscribe to and process messages?

Answer:
Subscription: 
  - Consumers subscribe to one or more topics to receive messages.

Processing:
  - Consumers poll for messages from assigned partitions.
  - Once a message is consumed, the consumer can commit the offset to track progress.
  - Messages are processed based on the application's logic.

#### ✅ What is a Consumer Group in Kafka, and why is it important?

Answer:
  - Consumer Group: Consumers with the same group ID belong to a consumer group.
  - Importance: Kafka ensures that each partition in a topic is consumed by only one consumer within a group. This allows for parallel processing and load balancing among consumers.

#### ✅ How does Kafka support real-time stream processing?

Answer:
  - Kafka Streams API: Enables the development of real-time stream processing applications directly within Kafka.
  - Allows the creation of applications that can ingest, transform, and produce streams of data in real-time.

#### ✅ Discuss the concept of log compaction in Kafka.

Answer:
  - Log Compaction: A feature that retains only the latest update for each key in a Kafka log.
  - Ensures that the log contains a full snapshot of the data, eliminating redundant updates.
  - Useful for scenarios where retaining the latest state of each record is essential.

#### ✅ Can you provide an example of a use case where Kafka is beneficial?

Answer:
Use Case: 
  - Real-time Data Processing in E-commerce

Scenario: 
  - An e-commerce platform needs to process and analyze user activities (clicks, purchases) in real-time.

Benefit of Kafka:
  - Producers can send events for user activities to Kafka topics.
  - Multiple consumers in a group can process these events concurrently.
  - The fault-tolerant and scalable nature of Kafka ensures reliable and efficient processing.
