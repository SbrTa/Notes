# Scenarios and Problem-solving


#### ✅ Describe a situation where you implemented Event-Driven Architecture in a project. What challenges did you face?

In a retail system, I implemented an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) to handle order processing. Challenges included ensuring proper event ordering for consistent inventory updates, managing event schemas evolution, and addressing the complexity of debugging asynchronous interactions. Additionally, achieving the right balance between event granularity and performance was crucial.

#### ✅ How would you design an event-driven system to handle a sudden spike in message throughput?

Scaling:
  - Utilize auto-scaling mechanisms to dynamically adjust resources based on workload.
  - Employ horizontal scaling for individual microservices to distribute the increased load.

Load Balancing:
  - Implement load balancing to evenly distribute incoming events among available instances.
  - Use event partitioning to ensure balanced processing across multiple consumers.

Backpressure Handling:
  - Introduce backpressure mechanisms to temporarily slow down producers during high loads, preventing system overload.

#### ✅ Discuss the trade-offs between message ordering and system performance in EDA.

Message Ordering:
  - Pros: Ensures consistent state transitions and simplifies reasoning about system behavior.
  - Cons: May lead to increased latency and potential bottlenecks, limiting system performance.

System Performance:
  - Pros: Enables parallel processing and scalability, improving throughput.
  - Cons: May result in out-of-order processing, requiring careful handling for certain use cases.

Trade-off Considerations:
  - The importance of ordering depends on the specific use case and the impact of potential inconsistencies.
  - Balancing ordering requirements with the need for high performance involves careful consideration of system requirements.

#### ✅ How do you ensure that events are processed exactly once in an event-driven system?

  - Idempotent Processing: Design microservices to be idempotent, ensuring that processing the same event multiple times has the same outcome.
  - Transactionality: Use distributed transaction mechanisms when necessary to maintain atomicity during event processing.
  - Event Acknowledgments: Implement acknowledgment mechanisms between producers and consumers to track processed events and handle duplicates.
  - Message Deduplication: Leverage message deduplication strategies, such as using unique message identifiers, to identify and discard duplicate messages.

#### ✅ Explain how you would implement a dead-letter queue in a message broker for handling failed messages.

  - Configure a separate queue, the dead-letter queue, to capture messages that fail processing.
  - Define retry policies before moving messages to the dead-letter queue to allow for automatic retries.
  - Implement monitoring and logging to identify and address recurring issues causing messages to be moved to the dead-letter queue.

#### ✅ Discuss the considerations for choosing the appropriate message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for a specific use case.

  - Throughput Requirements: Kafka excels in high-throughput scenarios, while RabbitMQ is suitable for traditional messaging.
  - Ordering Requirements: Kafka provides strong ordering guarantees, whereas RabbitMQ may sacrifice strict ordering for performance.
  - Use Case Complexity: Kafka is preferable for complex event streaming, while RabbitMQ may be simpler for straightforward messaging.
  - Scalability: Kafka offers seamless horizontal scalability, making it suitable for large-scale deployments.

#### ✅ How would you handle backward compatibility in an event-driven system when changing event schemas?

  - Use a schema evolution strategy that allows the introduction of new fields without breaking existing consumers.
  - Maintain backward compatibility by ensuring that existing consumers can handle both old and new event formats during a transition period.
  - Clearly communicate changes to all stakeholders to coordinate updates and minimize disruptions.

#### ✅ Describe a scenario where eventual consistency is acceptable in an event-driven architecture.

In a collaborative document editing system, eventual consistency is acceptable. When multiple users edit the same document concurrently, the system may temporarily exhibit inconsistencies. However, eventual consistency ensures that, over time, all replicas converge to a consistent state, allowing users to see a unified document state after some delay.

#### ✅ How do you manage dependencies between microservices in an event-driven system?

Decentralized Communication:
  - Promote decentralized communication through events, reducing direct dependencies between microservices.
  - Microservices emit events and react to events, allowing for asynchronous, loosely coupled interactions.

Service Discovery:
  - Utilize service discovery mechanisms to dynamically locate and connect to microservices when needed.
  - Leverage tools like Consul or Eureka for automated service discovery.

Dependency Inversion:
  - Apply the dependency inversion principle, where high-level policies are defined by microservices, and low-level details are handled by events and listeners.

#### ✅ Discuss the role of event versioning and evolution in a long-running event-driven system.

Event Versioning:
  - Assign version numbers to events to track changes over time.
  - Use backward-compatible changes for smooth transitions, introducing new versions as needed.

Evolution:
  - Allow for the evolution of events by enabling consumers to understand and process different event versions.
  - Employ version negotiation mechanisms to ensure compatibility between producers and consumers during transitional periods.
