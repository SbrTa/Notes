# AOP Interview Questions

#### ✅ What are cross-cutting concerns?

Answer: Cross-cutting concerns are aspects of a program that affect multiple modules or components. These concerns often relate to functionality that is needed by various parts of an application but doesn't fit neatly into a single module. Examples of cross-cutting concerns include logging, security, transaction management, and error handling. 

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm specifically designed to address cross-cutting concerns by separating them from the main business logic. Spring AOP follows proxy-based pattern and this is created by the AOP framework to implement the aspect contracts in runtime.

#### ✅ How do you implement cross-cutting concerns in a web application?

Answer: Cross-cutting concerns can be implemented in a web application using various techniques. Some common approaches include:
  - Manual Implementation: Developers manually insert code for cross-cutting concerns in multiple places within the application code. This approach, while straightforward, can lead to code duplication and maintenance challenges.
  - Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): AOP provides a more systematic approach to handling cross-cutting concerns. With AOP, you can define aspects that encapsulate cross-cutting behavior and apply them across the application without modifying the core business logic.
  - Interceptors: Many web frameworks, including Spring MVC, provide interceptors. Interceptors allow you to pre-process or post-process HTTP requests, enabling the implementation of cross-cutting concerns.

#### ✅ If you would want to log every request to a web application, what are the options you can think of?

Answer: To log every request in a web application, you can consider the following options:
  - Filter or Interceptor: Use a servlet filter or a Spring MVC interceptor to intercept incoming requests. Log the necessary information before passing the request down the filter chain or interceptor stack.
  - AOP Aspect: Implement an AOP aspect that captures the loggable information before or after method execution. Apply the aspect to relevant methods or classes.
  - Logging Framework Integration: Leverage a logging framework like Logback or Log4j to log information at various levels. Configure the logging framework to capture request-related data.
  - Spring Boot Middleware: If you are using Spring Boot, you can leverage Spring Boot's built-in features, such as HandlerInterceptor or @RestControllerAdvice, to capture and log request-related information.

#### ✅ If you would want to track the performance of every request, what options can you think of?

Answer: To track the performance of every request, you can consider the following options:
  - Profiling Tools: Use profiling tools or a Java profiler to analyze the performance characteristics of your application. Profilers can provide detailed insights into method execution times and resource utilization.
  - Instrumentation Libraries: Integrate instrumentation libraries, such as Spring Boot Actuator or Micrometer, to capture performance metrics automatically. These libraries often provide endpoints for monitoring and exposing metrics.
  - AOP Performance Monitoring Aspect: Implement a custom AOP aspect that measures the execution time of methods. Apply the aspect to relevant methods or classes to capture performance data.
  - Middleware Metrics: If you are using Spring Boot, consider using built-in features like Actuator, which exposes various metrics, including request/response times, through dedicated endpoints.

#### ✅ AOP Core Concepts
**Aspect**: An aspect is a class that implements enterprise application concerns that cut across multiple classes, such as transaction management. Aspects can be a normal class configured through Spring XML configuration or we can use Spring AspectJ integration to define a class as Aspect using @Aspect annotation.

**Join Point**: A join point is a specific point in the application such as method execution, exception handling, changing object variable values, etc. In Spring AOP a join point is always the execution of a method.

**Advice**: Advices are actions taken for a particular join point. In terms of programming, they are methods that get executed when a certain join point with matching pointcut is reached in the application. You can think of Advices as Struts2 interceptors or Servlet Filters.

**Pointcut**: Pointcut is expressions that are matched with join points to determine whether advice needs to be executed or not. Pointcut uses different kinds of expressions that are matched with the join points and Spring framework uses the AspectJ pointcut expression language.

**Target Object**: They are the object on which advices are applied. Spring AOP is implemented using runtime proxies so this object is always a proxied object. What is means is that a subclass is created at runtime where the target method is overridden and advice are included based on their configuration.

**AOP proxy**: Spring AOP implementation uses JDK dynamic proxy to create the Proxy classes with target classes and advice invocations, these are called AOP proxy classes. We can also use CGLIB proxy by adding it as the dependency in the Spring AOP project.

**Weaving**: It is the process of linking aspects with other objects to create the advised proxy objects. This can be done at compile time, load time or at runtime. Spring AOP performs weaving at the runtime.

#### ✅ What are the different types of AOP advices?

Answer:
  - **Before Advice**: Executed before the target method's invocation. It can modify the method arguments or perform other actions before the actual method execution.
  - **After Returning Advice**: Executed after the target method successfully completes its execution. It runs when the method returns without throwing an exception.
  - **After Throwing Advice**: Executed if the target method throws an exception. It allows handling exceptions raised by the target method.
  - **After (Finally) Advice**: Executed after the target method, regardless of whether it completes successfully or throws an exception. It is commonly used for cleanup operations.
  - **Around Advice**: Wraps around the target method, providing full control over its invocation. It can modify method parameters, alter the return value, or skip the method execution altogether.

#### ✅ What is weaving?

Answer: Weaving is the process of integrating aspects into the main business logic of an application. In AOP, aspects are woven into the code at specific points, known as join points. There are two main types of weaving:
  - Compile-Time Weaving (CTW): Aspects are woven into the code during the compilation phase. The bytecode of the application is modified to include the aspect's behavior. AspectJ is an example of a tool that supports compile-time weaving.
  - Load-Time Weaving (LTW): Aspects are woven into the code dynamically at runtime, as classes are loaded into the JVM. This allows for more flexibility and the ability to apply aspects without modifying the original source code. Spring AOP often uses load-time weaving.

#### ✅ Compare Spring AOP vs. AspectJ?

Answer:

Integration with Spring:
  - Spring AOP: Integrated with the Spring IoC container. It uses proxy-based AOP and is part of the core Spring framework.
  - AspectJ: Can be used independently of Spring. Provides more advanced features and can be used with any Java application, not just Spring-based ones.

Weaving:
  - Spring AOP: Primarily supports runtime weaving (load-time weaving). It creates proxies to achieve AOP and is less invasive.
  - AspectJ: Supports both compile-time and runtime weaving. Offers greater flexibility in terms of weaving options.

Ease of Use:
  - Spring AOP: Designed to be simpler and more lightweight. Ideal for scenarios where simplicity and integration with the Spring framework are priorities.
  - AspectJ: More powerful and feature-rich but comes with a steeper learning curve. Suitable for complex AOP scenarios and when advanced weaving options are required.

Performance:
  - Spring AOP: Generally provides good performance for most use cases. Uses proxy-based AOP, which may introduce some overhead.
  - AspectJ: Can offer better performance in certain scenarios, especially with compile-time weaving, as it modifies the bytecode directly.

Dependency Injection:
  - Spring AOP: Integrates seamlessly with Spring IoC and supports dependency injection of aspects.
  - AspectJ: Does not provide native support for dependency injection but can be used alongside Spring for DI.

In summary, Spring AOP is a more lightweight and Spring-centric solution, suitable for simpler AOP requirements within a Spring application. AspectJ provides a more comprehensive and powerful AOP solution with broader use cases but may be overkill for simpler scenarios.
