# Spring Boot Interview Questions

#### ✅ What is Spring Boot?

Answer: Spring Boot is an open-source framework developed by the Pivotal team and is part of the larger Spring Framework. It is designed to simplify the process of building, deploying, and running production-ready applications based on the Spring Framework. Spring Boot provides a convention-over-configuration approach, which means developers can get started with minimal setup and configuration, focusing more on application development and less on infrastructure.

#### ✅ What are the important Goals of Spring Boot?

Answer: The important goals of Spring Boot include:
  - Simplify Configuration: Reduce the need for extensive configuration and provide sensible defaults for application setup.
  - Create Standalone Applications: Enable the creation of standalone, self-contained applications with an embedded server (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty).
  - Provide Production-Ready Defaults: Provide production-ready defaults for metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.
  - Promote Code-Driven Development: Encourage a code-driven development approach with minimal XML configuration.
  - Offer a Rich Set of Features: Offer a rich set of pre-built features, such as security, data access, and messaging, to simplify application development.
  - Support Microservices Architecture: Facilitate the development of microservices-based applications by providing features like embedded servers, cloud integration, and externalized configuration.

#### ✅ What are the important Features of Spring Boot?

Answer: Some important features of Spring Boot include:
  - Auto Configuration: Automatically configures application components based on dependencies and project settings.
  - Standalone: Allows the creation of standalone, production-ready applications with embedded servers.
  - Opinionated Defaults: Provides sensible defaults for application configuration to minimize boilerplate code.
  - Microservices Support: Facilitates the development of microservices-based applications.

  - Avoid additional configuration
  - Embedded tomcat
  - Provide production ready feature such as metrics, health checks

#### ✅ Compare Spring Boot vs Spring MVC?

Answer:
  - Spring MVC: It is a web module within the Spring Framework that provides a model-view-controller architecture for building web applications. Spring MVC is part of the larger Spring ecosystem and requires configuration for setting up the web application, dispatcher servlet, and other components.
  - Spring Boot: It is a project that simplifies the development of Spring applications, including Spring MVC applications. Spring Boot provides defaults and auto-configuration for Spring MVC, allowing developers to quickly set up a web application with minimal configuration. It simplifies the process of creating standalone, production-ready Spring MVC applications.

#### ✅ What is the importance of @SpringBootApplication?

Answer: The @SpringBootApplication annotation is a meta-annotation that combines three commonly used annotations in Spring Boot applications:
  - **@Configuration**: Registers custom configs.
  - **@EnableAutoConfiguration**: Enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism based on dependencies.
  - **@ComponentScan**: Scans for Spring components (e.g., controllers, services, repositories) in the specified packages.

Using @SpringBootApplication on the main application class simplifies the setup and configuration of a Spring Boot application. It is often placed on the class containing the main method to indicate the starting point of the application. The annotation encapsulates several commonly used annotations, reducing the need for developers to apply them individually.

Example:
```
@SpringBootApplication
public class MySpringBootApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MySpringBootApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

#### ✅ What is Auto Configuration?

Answer: Auto Configuration is a key feature of Spring Boot that aims to simplify the configuration process by automatically configuring the application based on its dependencies and the project's setup. Spring Boot uses conditional annotations and default values to configure beans and components, reducing the need for extensive manual configuration.

Auto Configuration allows developers to get started with Spring Boot applications quickly, providing sensible defaults for various components such as data sources, security, and web applications. It is triggered when specific conditions are met, and it automatically configures beans based on the classpath and available dependencies.

Example:

```
// Auto Configuration for DataSource based on classpath and properties
@Configuration
@ConditionalOnClass({ DataSource.class, EmbeddedDatabaseType.class })
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "spring.datasource.url")
class DataSourceAutoConfiguration {
    // Configuration for DataSource
    // ...
}
```
In this example, DataSourceAutoConfiguration is an example of an auto-configuration class that configures a DataSource bean if specific conditions are met.


#### ✅ How can we find more information about Auto Configuration?

Answer: To find more information about Auto Configuration in Spring Boot, you can refer to the official Spring Boot documentation. The documentation provides detailed explanations of various auto-configuration classes, conditions, and properties that influence the auto-configuration process. Additionally, you can explore the source code of Spring Boot itself, as the auto-configuration classes are often well-commented, providing insights into the configuration logic.

#### ✅ What is an embedded server? Why is it important?

Answer: An embedded server is a server that is embedded within the application itself and is responsible for handling HTTP requests and serving content. In the context of Spring Boot, an embedded server eliminates the need for deploying and configuring an external server (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty) separately. It simplifies the deployment process, making the application self-contained and easy to run.

The importance of an embedded server in Spring Boot includes:
  - Simplified Deployment: No need to separately install and configure an external server.
  - Stand-Alone Applications: Allows the creation of stand-alone applications with an embedded server.
  - Ease of Development: Facilitates rapid development and testing without the complexities of external server setup.
  - Packaging: Simplifies application packaging, making it easier to distribute and deploy.

#### ✅ What is the default embedded server with Spring Boot?

Answer: The default embedded server with Spring Boot is Tomcat. Tomcat is widely used and well-integrated with Spring Boot. When you create a Spring Boot web application, Tomcat is included as the default embedded server unless you explicitly choose a different one.

#### ✅ What are the other embedded servers supported by Spring Boot?

Answer: Spring Boot supports several embedded servers, and you can choose a different one based on your requirements. Some of the other embedded servers supported by Spring Boot include:
  - Jetty: A lightweight and highly extensible embedded server.
  - Undertow: A high-performance web server designed for modern applications.
  - Netty: A non-blocking, event-driven server architecture.

To use a different embedded server, you can exclude the default and include the one you prefer in your project's dependencies.

#### ✅ What are Starter Projects?

Answer: Starter Projects, commonly referred to as "Starters," are pre-configured, ready-to-use project templates in Spring Boot. They are designed to simplify the setup and configuration of specific types of applications by providing a set of common dependencies, configuration, and best practices. Starters help developers bootstrap their projects quickly and follow recommended practices for various use cases, such as web applications, data access, messaging, etc.

Each Starter Project includes a curated set of dependencies, so developers don't have to manually configure them. Starters can be easily added to a project's build file (e.g., Maven or Gradle), reducing the need for developers to search for and add individual dependencies.

#### ✅ Can you give examples of important starter projects?

Answer: Some examples of important starter projects in Spring Boot include:
  - spring-boot-starter-web: Provides dependencies for building web applications with Spring MVC.
  - spring-boot-starter-data-jpa: Includes dependencies for Spring Data JPA and Hibernate for data access.
  - spring-boot-starter-security: Adds dependencies for securing Spring Boot applications using Spring Security.
  - spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf: Includes Thymeleaf templating engine for building web views.
  - spring-boot-starter-actuator: Adds dependencies for Spring Boot Actuator, providing production-ready features like health checks and metrics.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other starters tailored for specific use cases, such as messaging, caching, and more. You can explore and choose starters based on the requirements of your project.

#### ✅ What is Starter Parent?

Answer: spring-boot-starter-parent is a special starter project in Spring Boot that provides default configurations, plugins, and dependencies for building Spring Boot applications. It serves as the parent project for your Spring Boot application, allowing you to inherit common configurations and manage versioning for dependencies.

By using spring-boot-starter-parent as the parent project in your Maven or Gradle build file, you inherit a set of default configurations, including the Maven and Java versions, plugin configurations, and commonly used dependencies. This helps in maintaining consistency across multiple Spring Boot projects and simplifies the management of project configurations.

Example (Maven):

```
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.6.0</version>
</parent>
```
In this example, the <parent> section in the Maven build file indicates that the project inherits from spring-boot-starter-parent version 2.6.0.

#### ✅ What are the different things that are defined in Starter Parent?

Answer: The spring-boot-starter-parent defines various configurations and defaults for Spring Boot projects. Some of the key elements include:
  - Default Versions: It specifies default versions for commonly used dependencies, such as Spring Boot, Spring Framework, and other related libraries. This helps in maintaining consistency across projects.
  - Default Plugin Configurations: Configurations for Maven or Gradle plugins that are commonly used in Spring Boot projects, such as the Spring Boot Maven Plugin.
  - Default Property Configurations: Common property configurations, such as encoding settings, compiler plugin configurations, and resource filtering.
  - Default Plugin Management: Plugin management for plugins used in Spring Boot projects, ensuring consistent versions and configurations.

By inheriting from spring-boot-starter-parent, projects automatically benefit from these default settings, reducing the need for developers to specify them manually in their build files.

#### ✅ How does Spring Boot enforce common dependency management for all its Starter projects?

Answer: Spring Boot enforces common dependency management for all its Starter projects through the use of the spring-boot-dependencies project. This project defines a managed set of dependencies with their versions, and it is imported by the spring-boot-starter-parent. By doing so, all Starter projects inherit the common versions specified in spring-boot-dependencies.

Here's a simplified example of how spring-boot-starter-parent imports the spring-boot-dependencies:

```
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <!-- Import the spring-boot-dependencies -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>2.6.0</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
        <!-- Other dependency management entries -->
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

The spring-boot-dependencies project includes dependency management for a wide range of libraries commonly used in Spring Boot applications. This ensures that all Starter projects use consistent versions of these dependencies.

#### ✅ What is Spring Initializr?

Answer: Spring Initializr is a web-based tool provided by the Spring team for generating project skeletons (boilerplate code) for Spring Boot applications. It allows developers to quickly bootstrap Spring Boot projects with the desired configuration, dependencies, and project structure. Spring Initializr provides a user-friendly interface where developers can customize their project settings and download a pre-configured project archive.

Key features of Spring Initializr include selecting the project's language (Java or Kotlin), choosing the packaging type (JAR or WAR), specifying dependencies, and configuring project metadata. Developers can access Spring Initializr through a web interface or use it programmatically as an API.

Access Spring Initializr online: https://start.spring.io/

#### ✅ What is application.properties?

Answer: application.properties is a configuration file in Spring Boot applications that allows developers to configure various settings for their application. It follows the key-value pair format, where each line represents a configuration property and its corresponding value. application.properties is used to define properties related to the application's behavior, data sources, logging, and more.

Example of application.properties:

```
# Database configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=secret

# Logging configuration
logging.level.org.springframework=INFO
```

Spring Boot automatically reads and applies configurations from application.properties during application startup.

#### ✅ What are some of the important things that can be customized in application.properties?

Answer: Some important things that can be customized in application.properties include:
  - Data Source Configuration: Properties for configuring data sources, such as spring.datasource.url, spring.datasource.username, and spring.datasource.password.
  - Logging Configuration: Properties for configuring logging levels, file locations, and log formatting, such as logging.level, logging.file, and logging.pattern.
  - Server Configuration: Properties for configuring the embedded server, such as server.port, server.context-path, and server.ssl.
  - Spring Profiles: Properties can be defined for specific profiles, allowing configuration variations for different environments or use cases.
  - Thymeleaf Configuration: Properties for configuring the Thymeleaf templating engine, such as spring.thymeleaf.prefix and spring.thymeleaf.suffix.
  - Security Configuration: Properties for configuring Spring Security, such as spring.security.user.name and spring.security.user.password.

These are just a few examples, and application.properties can be used to configure a wide range of settings based on the needs of the application.

#### ✅ How do you externalize configuration using Spring Boot?

Answer: Spring Boot allows externalizing configuration using external property files or environment variables. By default, Spring Boot looks for application.properties or application.yml in the classpath. However, you can provide an external configuration file by specifying its location using the spring.config.location property.

Example of specifying an external configuration file location:

```
java -jar myapplication.jar --spring.config.location=file:/path/to/custom-config.properties
```

This command runs the application with an external configuration file located at /path/to/custom-config.properties.

Additionally, you can use environment variables to override configuration properties. For example, setting the SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL environment variable will override the spring.datasource.url property.

#### ✅ How can you add custom application properties using Spring Boot?

Answer: To add custom application properties in Spring Boot, you can define them in the application.properties or application.yml file. Custom properties are defined as key-value pairs, and you can reference them in your application code using the @Value annotation or by using the Environment object.

Example of defining custom properties in application.properties:

```
# Custom properties
custom.property1=value1
custom.property2=value2
```

Example of referencing custom properties in a Spring component:

```
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyComponent {

    @Value("${custom.property1}")
    private String property1;

    @Value("${custom.property2}")
    private String property2;

    // Access property values in the component
}
```

In this example, the custom properties custom.property1 and custom.property2 are defined in the application.properties file and accessed in the MyComponent component using the @Value annotation.

#### ✅ What is @ConfigurationProperties?

Answer: @ConfigurationProperties is an annotation in Spring Boot that allows you to bind external configuration properties directly to a Java object. By annotating a class with @ConfigurationProperties, you can map configuration properties with a specified prefix to the fields of the class. This provides a convenient way to organize and access configuration settings in a strongly-typed manner.

Example of using @ConfigurationProperties:

```
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "custom")
public class CustomProperties {

    private String property1;
    private String property2;

    // Getters and setters

    // Access properties in the application code
}
```

In this example, the @ConfigurationProperties annotation is used with the prefix attribute set to "custom." This maps properties with the "custom" prefix from the configuration file to the corresponding fields in the CustomProperties class.

#### ✅ What is a profile?

Answer: In the context of Spring Boot, a profile is a way to segregate and customize configurations for different environments or use cases. Profiles allow developers to define specific sets of configuration properties that are activated based on the active profile. Profiles are useful for managing configurations for development, testing, production, or any other custom scenarios.

Profiles can be defined in various ways:
  - In application.properties or application.yml using the spring.profiles.active property.
  - Using the spring.profiles.active system property or environment variable.
  - Programmatically setting the active profiles in the application code.

Example of using profiles in application.properties:

```
# Common configuration
common.property=value1

# Development profile configuration
spring.profiles.active=dev
dev.property=value2

# Production profile configuration
spring.profiles.active=prod
prod.property=value3
```

In this example, the common.property is common to all profiles, and the dev.property and prod.property are specific to the "dev" and "prod" profiles, respectively. The active profile is specified using the spring.profiles.active property.

Profiles help in managing configuration variations and ensure that the application behaves differently in different environments.

#### ✅ How do you define beans for a specific profile?

Answer: To define beans for a specific profile in Spring Boot, you can use the @Profile annotation on the bean definition. The @Profile annotation allows you to conditionally enable or disable bean definitions based on the active profiles.

Example:

```
@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {

    @Bean
    @Profile("development")
    public DataSource dataSourceForDevelopment() {
        // Define a data source for development profile
        return new DriverManagerDataSource("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/devdb", "devuser", "devpassword");
    }

    @Bean
    @Profile("production")
    public DataSource dataSourceForProduction() {
        // Define a data source for production profile
        return new DriverManagerDataSource("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/proddb", "produser", "prodpassword");
    }
}
```

In this example, two DataSource beans are defined with @Profile("development") and @Profile("production"), respectively. The beans will be created based on the active profile during the application startup.

#### ✅ How do you create application configuration for a specific profile?

Answer: You can create application configuration for a specific profile in Spring Boot by organizing configuration properties in separate files named using the pattern application-{profile}.properties or application-{profile}.yml.

Example:

Create application-dev.properties for the "development" profile:

```
# Configuration for development profile
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/devdb
spring.datasource.username=devuser
spring.datasource.password=devpassword
```

Create application-prod.properties for the "production" profile:

```
# Configuration for production profile
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/proddb
spring.datasource.username=produser
spring.datasource.password=prodpassword
```

During application startup, the properties from the file corresponding to the active profile will be loaded.

#### ✅ How do you have different configuration for different environments?

Answer: Spring Boot allows you to have different configurations for different environments using various configuration files and environment-specific properties. Here are some approaches:
  - Application Properties Files: Create separate application-{environment}.properties or application-{environment}.yml files. Example: application-dev.properties, application-prod.properties.
  - Environment Properties: Use environment-specific properties in the main application.properties or application.yml. Example:
        ```
        # Common properties
        common.property=value1
        
        # Development environment properties
        spring.profiles.active=dev
        dev.property=value2
        
        # Production environment properties
        spring.profiles.active=prod
        prod.property=value3
        ```
  - System Properties or Environment Variables: Override properties using system properties or environment variables. Example:
        ```
        java -jar myapplication.jar --spring.profiles.active=dev
        ```
These approaches allow you to customize configurations based on different environments such as development, testing, and production.

#### ✅ What is Spring Boot Actuator?

Answer: Spring Boot Actuator is a set of production-ready features provided by Spring Boot for monitoring and managing applications in production environments. Actuator exposes various endpoints that provide insights into the application's runtime behavior, health, metrics, and more. These endpoints are accessible over HTTP or JMX, making it easy to integrate with monitoring tools and systems.

Key features of Spring Boot Actuator include:
  - Health Endpoint: Provides information about the application's health, indicating whether it's running smoothly.
  - Metrics Endpoint: Exposes a variety of metrics related to the application's performance, memory usage, garbage collection, and more.
  - Info Endpoint: Displays arbitrary application information.
  - Environment Endpoint: Shows details about the application's environment properties.
  - Loggers Endpoint: Allows viewing and modifying the application's log levels.
  - Thread Dump Endpoint: Provides a thread dump of the application for troubleshooting.
  - Heap Dump Endpoint: Generates a heap dump for analyzing memory usage.
  - Custom Endpoints: Allows the creation of custom endpoints to expose application-specific information.

To enable Spring Boot Actuator, you typically add the spring-boot-starter-actuator dependency to your project.

#### ✅ How do you monitor web services using Spring Boot Actuator?

Answer: Spring Boot Actuator provides several endpoints for monitoring web services. Two important endpoints are the health and metrics endpoints.

Health Endpoint:

The /actuator/health endpoint provides information about the application's health.
Example: http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

Metrics Endpoint:

The /actuator/metrics endpoint exposes various metrics about the application's performance.
Example: http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics
To enable these endpoints, ensure that the spring-boot-starter-actuator dependency is included in your project. Additionally, you can customize and secure the actuator endpoints in the application.properties or application.yml file.

Example of enabling all endpoints and allowing access:

```
# Enable all endpoints
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*

# Allow all users to access the endpoints
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
```

#### ✅ How do you find more information about your application environment using Spring Boot?

Answer: Spring Boot Actuator provides an env endpoint that allows you to retrieve information about the application's environment properties, including configuration properties, system properties, and environment variables.

Example: http://localhost:8080/actuator/env

This endpoint exposes a JSON or YAML representation of the application's environment, providing details about property sources, configurations, and other environment-related information.

Additionally, you can use the Info endpoint (/actuator/info) to display arbitrary information about the application. Custom properties can be added to the application.properties or application.yml file under the info namespace.

Example:

```
# Custom info properties
info.app.name=MyApplication
info.app.version=1.0.0
```

Accessing http://localhost:8080/actuator/info will display this custom information.

#### ✅ What is a CommandLineRunner?

Answer: CommandLineRunner is an interface in the Spring Boot framework that allows developers to run custom logic or tasks when the application starts. It provides a single method, run, which is executed after the Spring application context has been initialized.

```
@FunctionalInterface
public interface CommandLineRunner {

    void run(String... args) throws Exception;
}
```

To use CommandLineRunner, you can implement the interface and override the run method with the custom logic you want to execute at application startup. The args parameter allows you to access command-line arguments passed to the application.

Example:

```
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyCommandLineRunner implements CommandLineRunner {

    @Override
    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        // Custom logic to run at application startup
        System.out.println("Application started with command-line arguments: " + String.join(", ", args));
    }
}
```

In this example, the MyCommandLineRunner component is annotated with @Component to be automatically picked up by Spring. The run method prints a message when the application starts, including any command-line arguments.

Using CommandLineRunner is useful for tasks such as data initialization, scheduled jobs, or any custom logic that needs to be executed during application startup.


#### ✅ Difference between @Controller and @RestController.

@Controller:
  - Not Restful
  - Returns view name, view resolver resolver resolves the view to generate final html
  - To return json, need to add @ReseponseBody annotation to each method 

@RestController
  - @RestController = @Controller + @ReseponseBody
  - Restful
  - Returns json or xml
