# Springboot Interview Question


## Spring

✅ What is Loose Coupling?

Answer: Loose coupling is a design principle in software development where components or modules are designed to have minimal dependencies on each other. It aims to reduce the interdependence between different parts of a system, making the system more modular, maintainable, and flexible to changes.

✅ What is a Dependency?

Answer: In software development, a dependency is a situation where one component or module relies on another to accomplish a specific task or provide functionality. Dependencies can be in the form of classes, interfaces, or external libraries that are required for a component to function properly.

✅ What is IOC (Inversion of Control)?

Answer: Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle where the control flow of a program is inverted. Instead of the application controlling the flow of execution, control is delegated to an external entity, often a framework or container. In the context of Spring, IoC means that the Spring container manages the creation and lifecycle of objects, and the application relies on the container to provide and inject dependencies.

✅ What is Dependency Injection?

Answer: Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern and a technique in which the dependencies of a class are injected from the outside rather than being created within the class. This helps achieve loose coupling and makes the components more modular and testable. Spring uses DI to inject dependencies into beans managed by its IoC container.

✅ Can you give a few examples of Dependency Injection?

Answer: Examples of Dependency Injection in Spring include:

Constructor Injection:

java
Copy code
public class Example {
    private Dependency dependency;

    public Example(Dependency dependency) {
        this.dependency = dependency;
    }
}
Setter Injection:

java
Copy code
public class Example {
    private Dependency dependency;

    public void setDependency(Dependency dependency) {
        this.dependency = dependency;
    }
}

✅ What is Auto Wiring?

Answer: Autowiring is a feature in Spring that allows the Spring IoC container to automatically inject dependencies into a Spring bean. It reduces the need for explicit configuration by automatically wiring beans based on their types or names.

✅ What are the important roles of an IOC Container?

Answer: The important roles of an IoC container in Spring include:

Object Creation: The IoC container is responsible for creating and managing objects.
Dependency Injection: It injects dependencies into objects, promoting loose coupling.
Lifecycle Management: It manages the lifecycle of objects, creating and destroying them as needed.
Configuration Management: It reads configuration metadata to configure the application.

✅ What are Bean Factory and Application Context?

Answer: Bean Factory and Application Context are both types of IoC containers in Spring.

Bean Factory: It is the simplest form of the Spring IoC container, providing basic functionality for managing and configuring beans.

Application Context: It is a more advanced container that extends the functionality of the Bean Factory. It includes additional features like event propagation, application-layer services, and internationalization support.

✅ Can you compare Bean Factory with Application Context?

Answer:

Bean Factory: The Bean Factory is the simpler form of the IoC container, providing basic functionality for managing beans. It is suitable for resource-constrained environments or applications where advanced features are not required.

Application Context: The Application Context is a more advanced container that extends the capabilities of the Bean Factory. It includes features such as event propagation, AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) support, and additional enterprise-level services. It is generally preferred in modern Spring applications.

✅ How do you create an application context with Spring?

Answer: In Spring, you can create an application context using XML configuration or Java-based configuration.

XML Configuration:

xml
Copy code
<!-- Example XML Configuration -->
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <!-- Bean Definitions go here -->

</beans>
Java Configuration:

java
Copy code
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
}

✅ How does Spring know where to search for Components or Beans?

Answer: Spring uses component scanning to automatically discover and register Spring beans or components in the application context. Component scanning looks for components (classes annotated with @Component or its specializations) within specified packages.

✅ What is a Component Scan?

Answer: Component scanning is a feature in Spring that automatically detects and registers Spring beans (components) in the application context. It involves scanning specified packages for classes annotated with @Component or its specializations (@Service, @Repository, @Controller), and then creating and registering beans for those classes.

✅ How do you define a component scan in XML and Java Configurations?

XML Configuration:

xml
Copy code
<context:component-scan base-package="com.example.package" />
Java Configuration:

java
Copy code
@Configuration
@ComponentScan("com.example.package")
public class AppConfig {
    // other configurations and beans
}

✅ How is it done with Spring Boot?

In Spring Boot, component scanning is enabled by default. The main application class is usually annotated with @SpringBootApplication, which includes @ComponentScan and other annotations. Spring Boot automatically scans for components in the package and its sub-packages where the main application class is located.

✅ What does @Component signify?

The @Component annotation in Spring is used to indicate that a class is a Spring bean and should be automatically detected and registered during component scanning. It is a generic stereotype annotation that can be used for any plain old Java object (POJO) to make it a Spring-managed component.

✅ What does @Autowired signify?

The @Autowired annotation in Spring is used to automatically inject a dependent bean into the associated variable. It can be applied to fields, setter methods, and constructors. It is a form of Dependency Injection that helps achieve loose coupling in the application.

✅ What’s the difference Between @Controller, @Component, @Repository, and @Service Annotations in Spring?

While all these annotations (@Controller, @Component, @Repository, and @Service) are specializations of @Component, they are used to indicate the role of the annotated class in the application.

@Controller: Used to mark classes as Spring MVC controllers, handling web requests.
@Component: A generic stereotype annotation for any Spring-managed component.
@Repository: Indicates that the annotated class is a repository, typically a Data Access Object (DAO).
@Service: Indicates that the annotated class is a service, typically containing business logic.
What is the default scope of a bean?

The default scope of a bean in Spring is singleton. This means that the Spring container creates a single instance of the bean and shares it with all requesting objects.

✅ Are Spring beans thread safe?

The thread safety of Spring beans depends on their scope:

Singleton Scope: Beans with singleton scope are shared among multiple clients. If the bean is stateless or has proper synchronization, it can be considered thread-safe.

Prototype Scope: Beans with prototype scope create a new instance for each request. They are typically not thread-safe, and thread safety needs to be managed explicitly within the bean.

✅ What are the other scopes available?

Apart from the default singleton scope, other bean scopes in Spring include:

Prototype: A new instance is created each time the bean is requested.
Request: A new instance is created for each HTTP request (only valid in a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext).
Session: A new instance is created for each HTTP session (only valid in a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext).
Global Session: A new instance is created for each global HTTP session (only valid in a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext).

✅ How is Spring’s singleton bean different from the Gang of Four Singleton Pattern?

While both Spring's singleton bean and the Gang of Four Singleton Pattern aim to have a single instance of a class, they differ in their scopes:

Spring Singleton: The Spring singleton scope creates a single instance per Spring IoC container. This instance is shared by all the objects requesting it within the container.

Gang of Four Singleton Pattern: The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point to access it. However, it is the responsibility of the application to manage and enforce the single instance.

✅ What are the different types of dependency injections?

There are mainly three types of dependency injections in Spring:

Constructor Injection: Dependencies are injected through the constructor of the class.
Setter Injection: Dependencies are injected through setter methods of the class.
Method Injection: Dependencies are injected through methods of the class.

✅ What is setter injection?

Setter injection is a type of dependency injection in which dependencies are injected into a class through setter methods. This is achieved by annotating the setter method with @Autowired or by configuring the injection in the XML or Java configuration.

✅ What is constructor injection?

Answer: Constructor injection is a type of dependency injection in which dependencies are injected into a class through its constructor. The required dependencies are provided as parameters to the constructor when creating an instance of the class. Constructor injection is considered a best practice as it ensures that all required dependencies are provided at the time of object creation.

✅ How do you choose between setter and constructor injections?

Answer: The choice between setter and constructor injection depends on the specific requirements of the class:

Use Constructor Injection when you want to ensure that all dependencies are available at the time of object creation. This promotes immutability and makes the class more testable.

Use Setter Injection when you have optional dependencies or need to change dependencies at runtime. Setter injection provides flexibility and is useful when you want to inject dependencies after the object is created.

✅ What are the different options available to create Application Contexts for Spring?

Answer: There are several options to create Application Contexts in Spring:

ClassPathXmlApplicationContext: Loads context definitions from an XML file located in the classpath.
FileSystemXmlApplicationContext: Loads context definitions from an XML file in the filesystem.
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext: Loads context definitions from Java-based configuration classes annotated with @Configuration.
GenericWebApplicationContext: For web applications, loads context definitions from XML or Java-based configuration.

✅ What is the difference between XML and Java Configurations for Spring?

Answer:

XML Configuration: Involves defining beans and their relationships in XML files. Provides externalized configuration but may be more verbose.

Java Configuration: Involves using Java classes annotated with @Configuration to define beans and their relationships. Provides type safety and code readability, often considered more modern than XML configuration.

✅ How do you choose between XML and Java Configurations for Spring?

Answer: The choice between XML and Java configurations depends on personal preference, project requirements, and team conventions. XML configuration may be preferred for larger configurations, while Java configuration may be favored for type safety, refactoring support, and modern development practices.

✅ How does Spring do Autowiring?

Answer: Spring performs autowiring by automatically injecting dependencies into Spring beans. This is achieved through annotations like @Autowired. The Spring IoC container scans the classpath for components and automatically wires them together based on the specified autowiring mode.

✅ What are the different kinds of matching used by Spring for Autowiring?

Answer: Spring supports different autowiring modes, including:

No Autowiring (autowire="no"): Default. No autowiring is done.
Autowiring by Type (autowire="byType"): Injects a bean of the same data type.
Autowiring by Name (autowire="byName"): Injects a bean with a matching name.
Constructor Autowiring (autowire="constructor"): Similar to autowiring by type but used with constructors.

✅ How do you debug problems with Spring Framework?

Answer: To debug problems with the Spring Framework, you can:

Enable Debug Logging: Set the log level to debug for the Spring framework in your logging configuration.
Check Configuration: Verify that your XML or Java configurations are correct.
Inspect Beans: Check bean definitions, dependencies, and injection points.
Use Spring Tools: Utilize tools like Spring Boot Actuator or the Spring Tool Suite for debugging and monitoring.

✅ How do you solve NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException?

Answer: The NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException occurs when there are multiple beans of the same type, and Spring cannot determine which one to inject. To solve this:

Use @Qualifier annotation to specify the desired bean.
Change the bean names to be unique.
Use List or Map types in the injection point to handle multiple beans.

✅ How do you solve NoSuchBeanDefinitionException?

Answer: The NoSuchBeanDefinitionException occurs when Spring cannot find a bean of the specified type or name. To solve this:

Check if the bean is defined in the configuration.
Ensure the correct package is scanned for components.
Verify the spelling and case sensitivity of the bean name or type.

✅ What is @Primary?

Answer: The @Primary annotation in Spring is used to indicate that a particular bean should be given precedence when multiple beans of the same type exist. The bean annotated with @Primary will be chosen as the primary bean when autowiring by type.

✅ What is @Qualifier?

Answer: The @Qualifier annotation in Spring is used in conjunction with @Autowired to specify which bean to inject when multiple beans of the same type exist. It helps resolve ambiguity in autowiring scenarios.

✅ What is CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection)?

Answer: Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) is a Java EE standard that provides a set of services and APIs for achieving dependency injection and contextual lifecycle management in enterprise applications. CDI aims to simplify the development of modular and scalable applications by promoting loose coupling and reuse of components.

✅ Does Spring Support CDI?

Answer: While Spring is not a CDI implementation, it provides its own dependency injection and component management features. CDI is more closely associated with the Java EE platform, while Spring is a separate framework with its own approach to dependency injection.

✅ Would you recommend using CDI or Spring Annotations?

Answer: The choice between CDI and Spring annotations depends on the specific requirements of the project and the underlying technologies. If you are working in a Java EE environment, CDI might be the preferred choice. However, if you are developing in a Spring-centric environment or need additional features provided by the Spring framework, Spring annotations would be more appropriate.

✅ What are the major features in different versions of Spring?

Answer: The features in different versions of Spring evolve over time. Specific features depend on the version, but common themes include improvements in dependency injection, AOP, data access, and support for new technologies. The major versions include Spring 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, and 5.x.
