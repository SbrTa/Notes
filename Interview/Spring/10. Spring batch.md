# Spring batch


#### ✅ What is Spring Batch?
Spring Batch is a lightweight, comprehensive framework designed to facilitate the development of robust and scalable **batch processing applications** in the Java programming language. It is part of the larger Spring Framework ecosystem and provides a set of reusable components for batch processing.


#### ✅ Important features of Spring Batch.
Here are some important points highlighting why one might choose to use Spring Batch:
  - Transaction Management: Ensures atomicity in batch processing by managing transactions. Allows for rolling back changes in case of errors to maintain data integrity.
  - Chunk Based Processing: Efficiently processes large datasets by breaking them into smaller, manageable chunks. Enables parallelization for improved performance.
  - Declarative I/O: Abstracts I/O operations, providing high-level components (ItemReader, ItemProcessor, ItemWriter) for reading, processing, and writing data.  It provides I/O support for JMS, JDBC, Hibernate and more.
  - Start/Stop/Restart: Provides flexibility in managing batch jobs by supporting initiation, halting, and resuming of job execution. Allows for easy restart of jobs in case of failures.
  - Retry/Skip: Handles errors during processing by offering mechanisms for retrying or skipping items. 
  - Web based administration interface: Offers a user-friendly web interface for monitoring and managing batch jobs. Provides insights into job and step statuses, execution history, and parameter management.
