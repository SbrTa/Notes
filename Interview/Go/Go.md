# Go Interview Questions

#### ✅ What is Golang?
  - High level, general-purpose programming language.
  - Strongly and statically typed language.
  - Provides support for garbage collection and concurrent programming.
  - The programs are built by using packages that help in managing the dependencies efficiently.
  - It also uses a compile-link model for generating executable binaries from the source code.
  - It has a built-in collection of powerful standard libraries.
  - Go has first-class support for Concurrency having the ability to use multi-core processor architectures.
  - Go is a case-sensitive language.


#### ✅ What are Golang pointers?
Go Pointers are those variables that hold the address of any variables. Due to this, they are called special variables. Pointers support two operators:
  - *operator: This operator is called a dereferencing operator and is used for accessing the value in the address stored by the pointer.
  - &operator: This operator is called the address operator and is used for returning the address of the variable stored in the pointer.


#### ✅ Is it possible to return multiple values from a function in Go?
Yes. Multiple values can be returned in Golang by sending comma-separated values with the return statement and by assigning it to multiple variables in a single statement as shown in the example below:

```
func reverseValues(a,b string)(string, string){
    return b,a
}

func main(){
    val1,val2:= reverseValues("abc","def")
}
```
