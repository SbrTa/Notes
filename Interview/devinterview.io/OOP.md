# OOP Fundamentals

#### ✅ 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
**Answer:**
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which encapsulate data and behavior. It emphasizes concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

#### ✅ 2. What is the difference between procedural and Object-Oriented programming?
**Answer:**
- **Procedural Programming:** Focuses on procedures and routines. Data and procedures are separate, and functions operate on data.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Focuses on objects that combine data and behavior. Objects interact through well-defined interfaces, promoting encapsulation and modularity.

#### ✅ 3. What is encapsulation?
**Answer:**
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class). It hides the internal details of an object and restricts access to certain components, promoting data integrity and security.

#### ✅ 4. What is polymorphism? Explain overriding and overloading.
**Answer:**
- **Polymorphism:** The ability of objects to take on multiple forms. In Java, it includes method overloading and overriding.
- **Method Overloading:** Multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameter lists.
- **Method Overriding:** Providing a specific implementation for a method in a subclass that is already defined in its superclass.

#### ✅ 5. What is inheritance? Name some types of inheritance.
**Answer:**
Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP where a new class inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass). Types of inheritance include:
1. **Single Inheritance:** A class inherits from only one superclass.
2. **Multiple Inheritance:** A class inherits from multiple superclasses (not supported in Java).
3. **Multilevel Inheritance:** A class inherits from another class, creating a chain of inheritance.

#### ✅ 6. What is an abstraction? Name some abstraction techniques.
**Answer:**
Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on essential properties. Techniques include:
- **Abstract Classes:** Classes with abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.
- **Interfaces:** Define a contract of methods that implementing classes must adhere to.
- **Abstract Data Types (ADTs):** Represent data and operations, hiding implementation details.

#### ✅ 7. What is a class in OOP?
**Answer:**
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects in OOP. It defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.

#### ✅ 8. What is an object in OOP?
**Answer:**
An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and encapsulates data and methods that operate on the data.

#### ✅ 9. How do access specifiers work and what are they typically?
**Answer:**
Access specifiers (modifiers) control the visibility of classes, methods, and fields in Java. Three main types:
- **Public:** Accessible from any class.
- **Private:** Accessible only within the same class.
- **Protected:** Accessible within the same class and its subclasses.

#### ✅ 10. Name some ways to overload a method.
**Answer:**
Method overloading can be achieved by:
1. Changing the number of parameters.
2. Changing the data type of parameters.
3. Changing the order of parameters.

#### ✅ 11. What is cohesion in OOP?
**Answer:**
Cohesion refers to how closely the methods within a class are related to each other. High cohesion implies that methods work together toward a common goal, making the class more maintainable.

#### ✅ 12. What is coupling in OOP?
**Answer:**
Coupling measures the degree of dependence between classes. Loose coupling is desirable, indicating that changes in one class don't heavily impact another, promoting code flexibility and maintainability.


# Class Relationships and Design

#### ✅ 13. What is a constructor and how is it used?
**Answer:**
A constructor is a special method in a class responsible for initializing the object's state. It has the same name as the class and is called automatically when an object is created. Constructors are used to set initial values for object attributes.

#### ✅ 14. Describe the concept of destructor or finalizer in OOP.
**Answer:**
In Java, there are no destructors like in some other languages. Instead, Java has a garbage collector that automatically reclaims memory. The `finalize` method is called by the garbage collector before an object is reclaimed. However, it's often recommended to use other resource management techniques.

#### ✅ 15. Compare inheritance vs. mixin vs. composition.
**Answer:**
- **Inheritance:** Allows a class to inherit attributes and behaviors from another class, forming an 'is-a' relationship.
- **Mixin:** A way to reuse a class's code in multiple class hierarchies, providing specific functionalities to different classes.
- **Composition:** Involves creating objects of other classes within a class to reuse their functionalities, promoting 'has-a' relationships.

#### ✅ 16. Explain the concept of an interface and how it differs from an abstract class.
**Answer:**
- **Interface:** Defines a contract of methods that implementing classes must adhere to. All methods are abstract, and a class can implement multiple interfaces.
- **Abstract Class:** Can have a mix of concrete and abstract methods. A class can extend only one abstract class.

#### ✅ 17. Can a class have multiple parents in a single-inheritance system?
**Answer:**
No, in a single-inheritance system, a class can only inherit from one parent class. This is a limitation in languages that support single inheritance.

#### ✅ 18. How would you design a class to prevent it from being subclassed?
**Answer:**
Make the class `final` to prevent it from being subclassed. Alternatively, make the constructor private and provide a static factory method to create instances.

#### ✅ 19. Explain the 'is-a' vs 'has-a' relationship in OOP.
**Answer:**
- **'Is-a' Relationship:** Denotes inheritance, where a class is a subtype of another. Example: a Cat is a subtype of Animal.
- **'Has-a' Relationship:** Denotes composition, where a class has another class as a part. Example: a Car has an Engine.

#### ✅ 20. Explain how aggregation relationship is represented in OOP.
**Answer:**
Aggregation represents a 'whole-part' relationship where a class contains another class as a part, but the part can exist independently. It's represented by a diamond-headed arrow pointing to the 'whole' class.

#### ✅ 21. What is method overriding, and what rules apply to it?
**Answer:**
Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. Rules include matching method signature, covariant return types, and not reducing visibility.

#### ✅ 22. Describe the use of static methods and when they are appropriate.
**Answer:**
Static methods belong to the class rather than instances. They can be called using the class name and are appropriate when the method doesn't depend on instance-specific data. Utility methods and factory methods are often declared as static.


# Advanced OOP Concepts

#### ✅ 23. What is multiple inheritance and what are some of its disadvantages?
**Answer:**
Multiple inheritance is a feature that allows a class to inherit attributes and behaviors from more than one parent class. Disadvantages include the diamond problem, increased complexity, and potential ambiguity when methods or attributes with the same name exist in multiple parent classes.

#### ✅ 24. Can you explain the 'diamond problem' in multiple inheritance?
**Answer:**
The 'diamond problem' occurs when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. If the derived class calls a method implemented in the common ancestor, it may lead to ambiguity, as it's unclear which implementation to use.

#### ✅ 25. How does OOP languages support polymorphism under the hood?
**Answer:**
Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and dynamic dispatch. Under the hood, a vtable (virtual method table) is used, which is a table of function pointers associated with a class. During runtime, the correct method is called based on the actual object type.

#### ✅ 26. What are generics, and how can they be useful in OOP?
**Answer:**
Generics allow classes, interfaces, and methods to operate with types as parameters. They provide type safety, code reusability, and flexibility by enabling the creation of classes, interfaces, and methods that work with different types.

#### ✅ 27. Explain the concept of object composition and its benefits.
**Answer:**
Object composition involves creating objects by combining other objects. It promotes code reuse, flexibility, and modularity, allowing changes to be made to one part of the system without affecting others. It is an alternative to inheritance for building complex systems.

#### ✅ 28. What is Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)? Provide some examples of violation and adherence.
**Answer:**
Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. Violation examples include altering preconditions or postconditions, while adherence involves maintaining the expected behavior in all subclasses.

#### ✅ 29. What is the dependency inversion principle?
**Answer:**
The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) suggests that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but both should depend on abstractions. It promotes the use of interfaces or abstract classes to decouple components and make the system more flexible and maintainable.

#### ✅ 30. How can the open/closed principle guide object-oriented design?
**Answer:**
The Open/Closed Principle states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that new functionality can be added without altering existing code. It is achieved through the use of interfaces, abstract classes, and design patterns like the Strategy pattern.

#### ✅ 31. Describe how the Interface Segregation Principle affects system design.
**Answer:**
The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) suggests that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. It advocates breaking down large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones, reducing the impact of changes and promoting better client-specific interfaces.

#### ✅ 32. What is a mixin, and how does it differ from traditional inheritance?
**Answer:**
A mixin is a way to reuse a class's code in multiple class hierarchies. It is similar to traditional inheritance but without the is-a relationship. Mixins are usually smaller and more focused on providing specific functionalities, avoiding some of the issues associated with multiple inheritance.


# Practical Use and Patterns

#### ✅ 33. How would you refactor a class that has too many responsibilities?
**Answer:**
To refactor a class with too many responsibilities, I would apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). Identify distinct responsibilities within the class and create separate classes for each responsibility. This improves maintainability, readability, and allows for easier testing.

#### ✅ 34. Describe a singleton pattern and discuss its pros and cons.
**Answer:**
The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access. Pros include global access, lazy loading, and centralized control. Cons involve potential issues with multithreading, testing difficulties, and violating the Single Responsibility Principle.

#### ✅ 35. What is a factory method, and when should it be used?
**Answer:**
A factory method is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating instances but allows subclasses to alter the type of instances that will be created. It should be used when a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it needs to create.

#### ✅ 36. Explain the builder pattern and where you might apply it.
**Answer:**
The builder pattern is a creational pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. It allows step-by-step construction of an object. It is applied when an object has a large number of parameters, and it improves readability and avoids telescoping constructors.

#### ✅ 37. What is the prototype pattern, and how does it relate to OOP?
**Answer:**
The prototype pattern involves creating new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. It relates to OOP by allowing the creation of new objects without specifying their exact class. It provides a mechanism to clone objects and is particularly useful for complex object creation.

#### ✅ 38. When would you use the Adapter pattern?
**Answer:**
The Adapter pattern is used when an existing class's interface is not compatible with what a client expects. It allows the interface of an existing class to work with another interface. It is handy when integrating new functionality without modifying existing code.

#### ✅ 39. Can you explain the use of the Decorator pattern?
**Answer:**
The Decorator pattern involves attaching additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. It is useful for extending functionality in a flexible way, allowing the composition of behaviors at runtime. It promotes an open-closed principle and avoids class explosion.

#### ✅ 40. Describe the Observer pattern and a scenario in which you might use it.
**Answer:**
The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. It is used in scenarios like implementing event handling systems, where multiple components need to react to changes in another component.

#### ✅ 41. What are the advantages of using the Command pattern?
**Answer:**
Advantages of the Command pattern include decoupling the sender and receiver of a command, allowing parameterization of objects with different requests, and supporting undo operations. It enhances flexibility and extensibility by encapsulating requests as objects.

#### ✅ 42. How does the Strategy pattern provide flexibility in objects?
**Answer:**
The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the client to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime. This flexibility enables an object to vary its behavior independently, making it easy to extend or change algorithms.


# OOP Best Practices

#### ✅ 43. What are some common OOP design anti-patterns?
**Answer:**
Common OOP design anti-patterns include:
1. **God Object:** A single class that knows or does too much.
2. **Spaghetti Code:** Poorly structured and unorganized code.
3. **Blob:** A large, monolithic class that handles numerous responsibilities.
4. **Hardcoding:** Embedding constants or magic values directly in the code.

#### ✅ 44. How do you ensure that your objects are properly encapsulated?
**Answer:**
To ensure proper encapsulation:
1. **Use Access Modifiers:** Set appropriate access levels (public, private, protected).
2. **Hide Implementation Details:** Expose only necessary information via methods.
3. **Encapsulate State:** Keep the internal state private and provide controlled access.
4. **Avoid Public Fields:** Use getters and setters to control access.

#### ✅ 45. Name some techniques for reducing coupling between classes.
**Answer:**
Techniques to reduce coupling include:
1. **Dependency Injection (DI):** Injecting dependencies from external sources.
2. **Interfaces:** Using interfaces to define contracts between classes.
3. **Event-driven Architecture:** Decoupling components using events.
4. **Publish-Subscribe Pattern:** Components subscribe to events without direct dependencies.
5. **Service Locator Pattern:** Centralizing access to external services.

#### ✅ 46. How does immutability help in object-oriented design, and how can it be implemented?
**Answer:**
Immutability in OOP provides benefits like thread safety, simplicity, and easier reasoning. It can be implemented by:
1. **Final Fields:** Making fields final to prevent modification.
2. **Immutable Objects:** Creating objects whose state cannot be changed after creation.
3. **Defensive Copying:** Returning copies of mutable objects instead of originals.

#### ✅ 47. What tools or techniques would you use to document an object-oriented design?
**Answer:**
Tools and techniques for documenting OOP design include:
1. **UML Diagrams:** Use case, class, sequence diagrams, etc.
2. **Documentation Generators:** Tools like Javadoc or Doxygen.
3. **README Files:** Include high-level overviews and guidelines.
4. **Design Patterns Catalogs:** Documenting the application of design patterns.

#### ✅ 48. How do you address circular dependencies in an OOP system?
**Answer:**
Circular dependencies can be addressed by:
1. **Dependency Inversion:** Use interfaces or abstract classes to break direct dependencies.
2. **Dependency Injection:** Pass dependencies through constructor or setter injection.
3. **Separate Interfaces:** Define interfaces in a separate module to avoid cyclic dependencies.

#### ✅ 49. Explain how to apply unit testing to object-oriented code.
**Answer:**
To apply unit testing to object-oriented code:
1. **Isolate Units:** Test individual classes or methods in isolation.
2. **Mocking:** Use mocks or stubs to isolate dependencies.
3. **Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA):** Organize tests into setup, execution, and assertion phases.
4. **Test for Edge Cases:** Cover various scenarios, including boundary conditions.

#### ✅ 50. What strategies can be used to safely refactor legacy object-oriented code?
**Answer:**
Strategies for safely refactoring legacy OOP code:
1. **Incremental Refactoring:** Make small, incremental changes.
2. **Unit Testing:** Add tests to ensure existing functionality is not broken.
3. **Code Reviews:** Involve the team in reviewing refactoring efforts.
4. **Use Design Patterns:** Apply appropriate design patterns for better structure.

#### ✅ 51. How can the principles of OOP help in achieving a modular and maintainable codebase?
**Answer:**
OOP principles (SOLID) contribute to a modular and maintainable codebase by promoting:
1. **Single Responsibility:** Each class/module has a single responsibility.
2. **Open/Closed:** Code is open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution:** Subtypes can replace their base types seamlessly.
4. **Interface Segregation:** Client-specific interfaces prevent unnecessary dependencies.
5. **Dependency Inversion:** High-level modules depend on abstractions, not details.

#### ✅ 52. How do you balance the use of OOP principles with performance considerations in a system design?
**Answer:**
Balancing OOP principles with performance involves:
1. **Profile Code:** Identify performance bottlenecks using profiling tools.
2. **Selective Optimization:** Optimize critical sections rather than prematurely optimizing.
3. **Caching:** Use caching strategies for frequently accessed data.
4. **Asynchronous Processing:** Employ asynchronous patterns for parallelism.
5. **Evaluate Trade-offs:** Consider trade-offs between clean design and performance.
