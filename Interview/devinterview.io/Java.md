  java
  class Animal {
      void sound() {
          System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
      }
  }

  class Dog extends Animal {
      @Override
      void sound() {
          System.out.println("Dog barks");
      }
  }

  class Cat extends Animal {
      @Override

    ```


# Java Memory Management

#### ✅ 64. How does the heap work in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Heap in Java:**
  - The heap is a region of a computer's memory used for dynamic memory allocation.
  - In Java, objects are allocated memory in the heap.
  - Divided into two parts: Young Generation (Eden, S0, S1) and Old Generation (Tenured).
  - Garbage Collection (GC) occurs to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable.

#### ✅ 65. What are reference types in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Reference Types:**
  - In Java, there are four reference types:
    1. **Strong Reference:** The most common type, used for regular object references.
    2. **Soft Reference:** Objects are cleared at the discretion of the garbage collector when memory is low.
    3. **Weak Reference:** Objects are cleared eagerly by the garbage collector.
    4. **Phantom Reference:** Objects are finalized but not yet reclaimed.

#### ✅ 66. What is a memory leak and how would you prevent it in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Memory Leak:**
  - A memory leak occurs when an application allocates memory but fails to release it, leading to a gradual depletion of available memory.
  - In Java, memory leaks often happen when objects are unintentionally kept alive and not eligible for garbage collection.

- **Preventing Memory Leaks in Java:**
  1. **Nullify References:** Set object references to `null` when they are no longer needed.
  2. **Use try-with-resources:** Ensure that resources, like streams, are properly closed.
  3. **Profile and Monitor:** Use tools like profilers to analyze memory usage and identify leaks.
  4. **Properly Manage Threads:** Ensure proper management of threads to prevent thread-local memory leaks.

#### ✅ 67. Explain the concept of "Escape Analysis" in Java.
**Answer:**
- **Escape Analysis:**
  - Escape analysis is a compiler optimization technique that determines whether an object's reference can "escape" its local scope.
  - If an object is found to be used only within a method and doesn't escape to the outer scope (e.g., being passed to other methods or returned), the compiler may optimize by allocating it on the stack rather than the heap.
  - Reducing heap allocations can improve performance by avoiding garbage collection overhead.


# Java Annotations

#### ✅ 68. What are annotations in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Annotations in Java:**
  - Annotations are a form of metadata that provides information about the program to the compiler or runtime.

#### ✅ 69. Can you create your own annotations?
**Answer:**
- **Creating Custom Annotations:**
  - Yes, it's possible to create custom annotations in Java.
  - Use the `@interface` keyword to define an annotation. Example:
    ```java
    @interface MyAnnotation {
        String value() default "default value";
        int count() default 1;
    }
    ```
  - Annotations can include elements with default values.

#### ✅ 70. What built-in annotations are provided by Java?
**Answer:**
- **Built-in Annotations in Java:**
  1. **`@Override`:** Indicates that a method is intended to override a method in a superclass.
  2. **`@Deprecated`:** Marks a method, class, or field as deprecated.
  3. **`@SuppressWarnings`:** Instructs the compiler to suppress specific warnings.
  4. **`@FunctionalInterface`:** Indicates that an interface is meant to be a functional interface.

#### ✅ 71. How are annotations used in frameworks such as Spring or Hibernate?
**Answer:**
- **Annotations in Frameworks:**
  - **Spring Framework:**
    - Annotations like `@Autowired`, `@Component`, `@Controller`, etc., are used for dependency injection and component scanning.
    - They simplify configuration and reduce the need for XML-based configurations.

  - **Hibernate ORM:**
    - Annotations such as `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Column` are used for mapping Java objects to database tables.

#### ✅ 75. What is a PreparedStatement, and how does it prevent SQL injection?
**Answer:**

**PreparedStatement in JDBC:**
PreparedStatement is a feature in JDBC that allows precompilation of SQL queries with placeholders for parameters.
It inherits from the Statement interface and extends its functionality.
SQL queries with placeholders can be executed multiple times with different parameter values.

**Preventing SQL Injection:**
One of the main advantages of PreparedStatement is its ability to prevent SQL injection attacks.
SQL injection occurs when an attacker inserts malicious SQL code into input fields to manipulate the SQL query.
PreparedStatement automatically escapes and quotes the parameter values, making it immune to SQL injection attacks.
Example:

```java
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
try (PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    preparedStatement.setString(1, enteredUsername);
    preparedStatement.setString(2, enteredPassword);
    ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
    // Process the result
}
```

In this example, the ? placeholders are used, and values are set using the setString method. This ensures that the values are treated as data and not executable SQL code, preventing SQL injection.

Using PreparedStatement is considered a best practice for executing parameterized SQL queries in Java to enhance security and prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.


# Testing in Java
