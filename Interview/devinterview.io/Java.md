# Java Basics & Language Components

#### ✅ 1. Explain the main idea behind Java and the concept of Write Once, Run Anywhere.
**Answer:**
- **Main Idea:**
  - **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA):**
    - Java allows writing code on one device and running it on any device with Java support.
    - Achieved through the compilation of Java source code into bytecode.
    - Bytecode runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM), providing platform independence.

#### ✅ 2. What are the main features of Java?
**Answer:**
- **Main Features:**
  - **1. Simple:** Easy-to-learn syntax.
  - **2. Object-Oriented:** Emphasizes object-oriented programming concepts.
  - **3. Platform-Independent:** WORA principle.
  - **4. Distributed Computing:** Facilitates distributed computing via RMI and EJB.
  - **5. Secure:** Provides a secure execution environment.
  - **6. Robust:** Ensures reliability through strong memory management and exception handling.
  - **7. Multithreaded:** Supports concurrent execution of multiple threads.
  - **8. Dynamic:** Adapts to evolving environments.
  - **9. Architecture-Neutral:** No implementation-dependent features.

#### ✅ 3. Can you list some non-object-oriented features of Java?
**Answer:**
- **Non-Object-Oriented Features:**
  - **1. Primitive Data Types:** Java has primitive data types (int, char, etc.).
  - **2. Static Methods:** Java supports static methods.
  - **3. Static Variables:** Allows the use of static variables.

#### ✅ 4. Describe the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM.
**Answer:**
- **1. JDK (Java Development Kit):**
  - Comprehensive development kit containing JRE and development tools.
  - Used for developing, compiling, and running Java programs.

- **2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment):**
  - Runtime environment necessary for running Java applications.
  - Includes JVM, class libraries, and supporting files.

- **3. JVM (Java Virtual Machine):**
  - Virtual machine that executes Java bytecode.
  - Ensures platform independence by translating bytecode to machine code.

#### ✅ 5. What is the role of the ClassLoader?
**Answer:**
- **Role of ClassLoader:**
  - Responsible for loading Java classes into JVM.
  - Dynamic Class Loading: Classes are loaded as needed during runtime.
  - Supports the creation of Java objects from classes.

#### ✅ 6. What is the difference between a path and a classpath in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Path:**
  - Specifies the location of executable files (e.g., Java compiler) on the file system.

- **Classpath:**
  - Defines the location of Java classes used by the application.
  - JVM uses the classpath to locate classes during execution.

#### ✅ 7. Can you explain the difference between an int and an Integer in Java?
**Answer:**
- **int:**
  - Primitive data type representing a 32-bit signed integer.
  - Does not support null.

- **Integer:**
  - Wrapper class for the primitive int.
  - Allows null values and provides utility methods.

#### ✅ 8. What are wrapper classes in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Wrapper Classes:**
  - Classes that encapsulate primitive data types.
  - E.g., Integer, Double, Boolean.
  - Provide methods for converting primitive types to objects and vice versa.

#### ✅ 9. What does it mean that Java is a statically typed language?
**Answer:**
- **Statically Typed Language:**
  - Variable types are checked at compile-time.
  - Type declarations are required for variables.

#### ✅ 10. Is Java a pure object-oriented language? Why or why not?
**Answer:**
- **Java and Object-Oriented Paradigm:**
  - Java is not considered a pure object-oriented language.
  - Supports primitive data types and static methods.
  - Has non-object-oriented features.

#### ✅ 11. What is bytecode in the context of Java?
**Answer:**
- **Bytecode:**
  - Intermediate code generated by the Java compiler.
  - Platform-independent and executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
  - Allows Java programs to be WORA.

#### ✅ 12. How does garbage collection work in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Garbage Collection:**
  - Automatic memory management process.
  - Identifies and removes unreferenced objects.
  - Enhances memory efficiency and reduces memory leaks.

#### ✅ 13. What is the purpose of the 'final' keyword?
**Answer:**
- **Purpose of 'final' Keyword:**
  - Applied to variables, methods, and classes.
  - Implies that the entity is constant and cannot be changed.
  - Enhances predictability, optimization, and security.

#### ✅ 14. Can we overload or override static methods in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Overloading:** Yes, static methods can be overloaded.
- **Overriding:** No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java.

#### ✅ 15. What is the significance of the 'this' keyword in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Significance of 'this' Keyword:**
  - Refers to the current instance of the class.
  - Differentiates instance variables from local variables.
  - Used to invoke current object's method or constructor.
