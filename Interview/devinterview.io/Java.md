  - Classes implement interfaces using the `implements` keyword.
  - Supports multiple inheritance, as a class can implement multiple interfaces.

- **Abstract Classes:**
  - Can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
  - Declared using the `abstract` keyword.
  - Classes extend abstract classes using the `extends` keyword.
  - Can have fields (variables) with different access modifiers.

#### ✅ 19. Explain method overloading and method overriding.
**Answer:**
- **Method Overloading:**
  - Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
  - Parameters can differ in number, type, or both.

- **Method Overriding:**

  **Example:**
  ```
  java
  class Animal {
      void sound() {
          System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
      }
  }

  class Dog extends Animal {
      @Override
      void sound() {
          System.out.println("Dog barks");
      }
  }

  class Cat extends Animal {
      @Override
      void sound() {
          System.out.println("Cat meows");
      }
  }
  ```
  
#### ✅ 21. What is encapsulation in Java, and how is it achieved?

    // Read the response from the input stream.
    connection.disconnect();
    ```


# Java Memory Management

#### ✅ 64. How does the heap work in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Heap in Java:**
  - The heap is a region of a computer's memory used for dynamic memory allocation.
  - In Java, objects are allocated memory in the heap.
  - Divided into two parts: Young Generation (Eden, S0, S1) and Old Generation (Tenured).
  - Garbage Collection (GC) occurs to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable.

#### ✅ 65. What are reference types in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Reference Types:**
  - In Java, there are four reference types:
    1. **Strong Reference:** The most common type, used for regular object references.
    2. **Soft Reference:** Objects are cleared at the discretion of the garbage collector when memory is low.
    3. **Weak Reference:** Objects are cleared eagerly by the garbage collector.
    4. **Phantom Reference:** Objects are finalized but not yet reclaimed.

#### ✅ 66. What is a memory leak and how would you prevent it in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Memory Leak:**
  - A memory leak occurs when an application allocates memory but fails to release it, leading to a gradual depletion of available memory.
  - In Java, memory leaks often happen when objects are unintentionally kept alive and not eligible for garbage collection.

- **Preventing Memory Leaks in Java:**
  1. **Nullify References:** Set object references to `null` when they are no longer needed.
  2. **Use try-with-resources:** Ensure that resources, like streams, are properly closed.
  3. **Profile and Monitor:** Use tools like profilers to analyze memory usage and identify leaks.
  4. **Properly Manage Threads:** Ensure proper management of threads to prevent thread-local memory leaks.

#### ✅ 67. Explain the concept of "Escape Analysis" in Java.
**Answer:**
- **Escape Analysis:**
  - Escape analysis is a compiler optimization technique that determines whether an object's reference can "escape" its local scope.
  - If an object is found to be used only within a method and doesn't escape to the outer scope (e.g., being passed to other methods or returned), the compiler may optimize by allocating it on the stack rather than the heap.
  - Reducing heap allocations can improve performance by avoiding garbage collection overhead.


# Java Annotations

#### ✅ 68. What are annotations in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Annotations in Java:**
  - Annotations are a form of metadata that provides information about the program to the compiler or runtime.
  - Introduced in Java 5, they start with the `@` symbol and are used to provide additional information to the compiler, runtime, or tools.

#### ✅ 69. Can you create your own annotations?
**Answer:**
- **Creating Custom Annotations:**
  - Yes, it's possible to create custom annotations in Java.
  - Use the `@interface` keyword to define an annotation. Example:
    ```java
    @interface MyAnnotation {
        String value() default "default value";
        int count() default 1;
    }
    ```
  - Annotations can include elements with default values.

#### ✅ 70. What built-in annotations are provided by Java?
**Answer:**
- **Built-in Annotations in Java:**
  1. **`@Override`:** Indicates that a method is intended to override a method in a superclass.
  2. **`@Deprecated`:** Marks a method, class, or field as deprecated.
  3. **`@SuppressWarnings`:** Instructs the compiler to suppress specific warnings.
  4. **`@FunctionalInterface`:** Indicates that an interface is meant to be a functional interface.

#### ✅ 71. How are annotations used in frameworks such as Spring or Hibernate?
**Answer:**
- **Annotations in Frameworks:**
  - **Spring Framework:**
    - Annotations like `@Autowired`, `@Component`, `@Controller`, etc., are used for dependency injection and component scanning.
    - They simplify configuration and reduce the need for XML-based configurations.

  - **Hibernate ORM:**
    - Annotations such as `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Column` are used for mapping Java objects to database tables.
    - They provide a way to define the ORM mappings within the Java code.
