# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

#### ✅ 16. Explain the four main principles of OOP.
**Answer:**
- **Four Principles of OOP:**
  1. **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
  2. **Inheritance:** Mechanism for creating a new class (subclass) using the properties and behaviors of an existing class (superclass).
  3. **Polymorphism:** Ability of a method to take on multiple forms, achieved through method overloading and overriding.
  4. **Abstraction:** Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on relevant characteristics, ignoring unnecessary details.

#### ✅ 17. How does Java implement inheritance?
**Answer:**
- **Java Inheritance:**
  - Classes in Java can be derived from other classes.
  - Syntax: `class Subclass extends Superclass { ... }`.
  - Inherited members (fields and methods) are accessible in the subclass.
  - Supports single inheritance for classes and multiple inheritance through interfaces.

#### ✅ 18. What are interfaces, and how are they different from abstract classes?
**Answer:**
- **Interfaces:**
  - Collection of abstract methods (methods without implementation).
  - Declared using the `interface` keyword.
  - Classes implement interfaces using the `implements` keyword.
  - Supports multiple inheritance, as a class can implement multiple interfaces.

- **Abstract Classes:**
  - Can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
  - Declared using the `abstract` keyword.
  - Classes extend abstract classes using the `extends` keyword.
  - Can have fields (variables) with different access modifiers.

#### ✅ 19. Explain method overloading and method overriding.
**Answer:**
- **Method Overloading:**
  - Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
  - Parameters can differ in number, type, or both.

- **Method Overriding:**
  - Providing a specific implementation for a method in the subclass that is already defined in its superclass.
  - Requires the `@Override` annotation.
  - Enhances polymorphism and supports dynamic method dispatch.

#### ✅ 20. What is polymorphism in Java? Give an example.
**Answer:**
- **Polymorphism:**
  - Ability of a method to take on multiple forms.
  - Two types: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding).
  - Enhances flexibility and code reusability.

  **Example:**
  ```
  java
  class Animal {
      void sound() {
          System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
      }
  }

  class Dog extends Animal {
      @Override
      void sound() {
          System.out.println("Dog barks");
      }
  }

  class Cat extends Animal {
      @Override
      void sound() {
          System.out.println("Cat meows");
      }
  }
  ```
  
#### ✅ 21. What is encapsulation in Java, and how is it achieved?
**Answer:**
- **Encapsulation:**
  - Bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
  - Access to the internal details of an object is restricted.
  - Achieved through access modifiers (e.g., `private`, `protected`) and getter/setter methods.

#### ✅ 22. What is the Liskov Substitution Principle?
**Answer:**
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
  - States that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
  - Subtypes must adhere to the behavior specified by the supertype.
  - Ensures consistency in polymorphic behavior.

#### ✅ 23. Can you illustrate the concept of coupling and cohesion in software design?
**Answer:**
- **Coupling:**
  - Measure of how much one class relies on another.
  - High coupling indicates strong interdependence.
  - Low coupling promotes modularity and ease of maintenance.

- **Cohesion:**
  - Measure of how closely the members of a class are related to each other.
  - High cohesion indicates a focused, well-defined responsibility.

  - Include exceptions that extend `RuntimeException`.
  - Examples: `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

#### ✅ 36. How do you handle exceptions in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Handling Exceptions:**
  - Use `try`, `catch`, `finally` blocks.
  - Enclose risky code in the `try` block.
  - Provide exception-handling logic in the `catch` block.
  - `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.

#### ✅ 37. What is a finally block, and when is it used?
**Answer:**
- **finally Block:**
  - Used to ensure that a block of code is always executed, whether an exception is thrown or not.
  - Typically used for cleanup operations like closing resources.

#### ✅ 38. Is it possible to catch multiple exceptions in a single catch block? If yes, how?
**Answer:**
- **Multiple Exceptions in a Single Catch Block:**
  - Yes, you can catch multiple exceptions by separating them with the `|` (pipe) symbol.
  - Example: `catch (IOException | SQLException ex) { ... }`.

#### ✅ 39. Can you throw any exception inside a lambda expression in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Throwing Exceptions in Lambda Expressions:**
  - Lambda expressions can throw exceptions.
  - The exceptions thrown by a lambda expression must be compatible with the functional interface's `throws` clause.


# Java Concurrency

#### ✅ 40. What is the difference between a process and a thread in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Process:**
  - An independent program with its memory space and resources.
  - Processes do not share memory space.

  - Achieved using the `synchronized` keyword or using `Lock` interfaces.

#### ✅ 43. What is deadlocking in multithreading?
**Answer:**
- **Deadlock:**
  - Occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a lock.
  - A situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process.

#### ✅ 44. How can you avoid deadlocks?
**Answer:**
- **Avoiding Deadlocks:**
  - Lock ordering: Acquire locks in a consistent order.
  - Lock timeout: Release a lock if not acquired within a specified time.
  - Use higher-level concurrency utilities from the `java.util.concurrent` package.

#### ✅ 45. Can you explain the working of the volatile keyword?
**Answer:**
- **Volatile Keyword:**
  - Ensures visibility of changes to variables across threads.
  - Prevents thread caching of variables.
  - Useful for flags or variables accessed by multiple threads without other synchronization mechanisms.

#### ✅ 46. What is the difference between the synchronized method and synchronized block?
**Answer:**
- **Synchronized Method vs. Synchronized Block:**
  - **Method:** Entire method is synchronized.
  - **Block:** Only the specified block of code is synchronized.
  - Using synchronized blocks allows more fine-grained control over synchronization.

#### ✅ 47. How does the 'wait' and 'notify' mechanism work in Java's Object class?
**Answer:**
- **wait() and notify():**
  - Used for inter-thread communication.
  - `wait()`: Causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes `notify()` or `notifyAll()` for the object.
  - `notify()`: Wakes up one of the threads that are currently waiting on the object.

#### ✅ 48. What are Executors in Java concurrency?
**Answer:**
- **Executors:**
  - Part of the Java Concurrency framework.
