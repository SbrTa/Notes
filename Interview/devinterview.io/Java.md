# Java Basics & Language Components

#### ✅ 1. Explain the main idea behind Java and the concept of Write Once, Run Anywhere.
**Answer:**
- **Main Idea:**
  - **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA):**
    - Java allows writing code on one device and running it on any device with Java support.
    - Achieved through the compilation of Java source code into bytecode.
    - Bytecode runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM), providing platform independence.

#### ✅ 2. What are the main features of Java?
**Answer:**
- **Main Features:**
  - **1. Simple:** Easy-to-learn syntax.
  - **2. Object-Oriented:** Emphasizes object-oriented programming concepts.
  - **3. Platform-Independent:** WORA principle.
  - **4. Distributed Computing:** Facilitates distributed computing via RMI and EJB.
  - **5. Secure:** Provides a secure execution environment.
  - **6. Robust:** Ensures reliability through strong memory management and exception handling.
  - **7. Multithreaded:** Supports concurrent execution of multiple threads.
  - **8. Dynamic:** Adapts to evolving environments.

  - Dynamic Class Loading: Classes are loaded as needed during runtime.
  - Supports the creation of Java objects from classes.

#### ✅ 6. What is the difference between a path and a classpath in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Path:**
  - Specifies the location of executable files (e.g., Java compiler) on the file system.

- **Classpath:**
  - Defines the location of Java classes used by the application.
  - JVM uses the classpath to locate classes during execution.

#### ✅ 7. Can you explain the difference between an int and an Integer in Java?
**Answer:**
- **int:**
  - Primitive data type representing a 32-bit signed integer.
  - Does not support null.

- **Integer:**

  - Allows null values and provides utility methods.

#### ✅ 8. What are wrapper classes in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Wrapper Classes:**
  - Classes that encapsulate primitive data types.
  - E.g., Integer, Double, Boolean.
  - Provide methods for converting primitive types to objects and vice versa.

#### ✅ 9. What does it mean that Java is a statically typed language?
**Answer:**
- **Statically Typed Language:**

  - Type declarations are required for variables.

#### ✅ 10. Is Java a pure object-oriented language? Why or why not?
**Answer:**
- **Java and Object-Oriented Paradigm:**
  - Java is not considered a pure object-oriented language.
  - Supports primitive data types and static methods.
  - Has non-object-oriented features.

#### ✅ 11. What is bytecode in the context of Java?
**Answer:**
- **Bytecode:**
  - Intermediate code generated by the Java compiler.
  - Platform-independent and executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
  - Allows Java programs to be WORA.

#### ✅ 12. How does garbage collection work in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Garbage Collection:**

  - Implies that the entity is constant and cannot be changed.
  - Enhances predictability, optimization, and security.

#### ✅ 14. Can we overload or override static methods in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Overloading:** Yes, static methods can be overloaded.
- **Overriding:** No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java.

#### ✅ 15. What is the significance of the 'this' keyword in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Significance of 'this' Keyword:**
  - Refers to the current instance of the class.
  - Differentiates instance variables from local variables.
  - Used to invoke current object's method or constructor.



# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

#### ✅ 16. Explain the four main principles of OOP.
**Answer:**
- **Four Principles of OOP:**
  1. **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
  2. **Inheritance:** Mechanism for creating a new class (subclass) using the properties and behaviors of an existing class (superclass).
  3. **Polymorphism:** Ability of a method to take on multiple forms, achieved through method overloading and overriding.
  4. **Abstraction:** Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on relevant characteristics, ignoring unnecessary details.

#### ✅ 17. How does Java implement inheritance?
**Answer:**
- **Java Inheritance:**
  - Classes in Java can be derived from other classes.
  - Syntax: `class Subclass extends Superclass { ... }`.
  - Inherited members (fields and methods) are accessible in the subclass.
  - Supports single inheritance for classes and multiple inheritance through interfaces.

#### ✅ 18. What are interfaces, and how are they different from abstract classes?
**Answer:**
- **Interfaces:**
  - Collection of abstract methods (methods without implementation).
  - Declared using the `interface` keyword.
  - Classes implement interfaces using the `implements` keyword.
  - Supports multiple inheritance, as a class can implement multiple interfaces.

- **Abstract Classes:**
  - Can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
  - Declared using the `abstract` keyword.
  - Classes extend abstract classes using the `extends` keyword.
  - Can have fields (variables) with different access modifiers.

#### ✅ 19. Explain method overloading and method overriding.
**Answer:**
- **Method Overloading:**
  - Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
  - Parameters can differ in number, type, or both.

- **Method Overriding:**
  - Providing a specific implementation for a method in the subclass that is already defined in its superclass.
  - Requires the `@Override` annotation.
  - Enhances polymorphism and supports dynamic method dispatch.

#### ✅ 20. What is polymorphism in Java? Give an example.
**Answer:**
- **Polymorphism:**
  - Ability of a method to take on multiple forms.
  - Two types: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding).
  - Enhances flexibility and code reusability.

  **Example:**
  ```
  java
  class Animal {
      void sound() {
          System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
      }
  }

  class Dog extends Animal {
      @Override
      void sound() {
          System.out.println("Dog barks");
      }
  }

  class Cat extends Animal {
      @Override
      void sound() {
          System.out.println("Cat meows");
      }
  }
  ```
  
#### ✅ 21. What is encapsulation in Java, and how is it achieved?
**Answer:**
- **Encapsulation:**
  - Bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
  - Access to the internal details of an object is restricted.
  - Achieved through access modifiers (e.g., `private`, `protected`) and getter/setter methods.

#### ✅ 22. What is the Liskov Substitution Principle?
**Answer:**
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
  - States that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
  - Subtypes must adhere to the behavior specified by the supertype.
  - Ensures consistency in polymorphic behavior.

#### ✅ 23. Can you illustrate the concept of coupling and cohesion in software design?
**Answer:**
- **Coupling:**
  - Measure of how much one class relies on another.
  - High coupling indicates strong interdependence.
  - Low coupling promotes modularity and ease of maintenance.

- **Cohesion:**
  - Measure of how closely the members of a class are related to each other.
  - High cohesion indicates a focused, well-defined responsibility.
  - Promotes clarity, reusability, and maintainability.
