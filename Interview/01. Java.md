# Java Interview Question

#### ✅ JDK vs JRE vs JVM
  - JDK:
    - Java Development Kit aka JDK
    - Provides all the tools, executables, and binaries required to compile, debug, and execute a Java Program.
    - JDK is a platform-specific software and that’s why we have separate installers for Windows, Mac, and Unix systems.
    - JDK is the superset of JRE since it contains JRE with Java compiler, debugger, and core classes.
  
  - JRE:
    - JRE is the implementation of JVM.
    - Provides a platform to execute java programs.
    - JRE consists of JVM, Java binaries, and other classes to execute any program successfully.
    - JRE doesn’t contain any development tools such as Java compiler, debugger, JShell, etc.
    - If you just want to execute a java program, you can install only JRE. You don’t need JDK because there is no development or compilation of java source code is required.
  
  - JVM:
    - When we execute a Java program, JVM is responsible for converting the byte code to the machine-specific code.
    - JVM is also platform-dependent
    - Provides core java functions such as memory management, garbage collection, security, etc.
    - JVM is customizable and we can use java options to customize it. For example, allocating minimum and maximum memory to JVM.
    - JVM is called virtual because it provides an interface that does not depend on the underlying operating system and machine hardware. This independence from hardware and the operating system makes java program write-once-run-anywhere.

#### ✅ Some popular openJDK
  - Adoptium Eclipse Temurin: Adoptium Eclipse Temurin OpenJDK builds are highly recommended.
  - Amazon Corretto: Corretto builds are a good choice, particularly if you run Java applications directly on Amazon Linux 2 in AWS.
  - Azul Zulu: Azul Zulu Builds of OpenJDK are a good choice.
  - BellSoft Liberica JDK: BellSoft Liberica JDK builds are a good choice. The popular Spring Boot framework chose Liberica JDK as runtime for their buildpack.
  - Microsoft Build of OpenJDK: Use Microsoft Build of OpenJDK, only if you run Java applications directly on Azure. There are more established options available.
