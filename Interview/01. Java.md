# Java Interview Question

#### ✅ JDK vs JRE vs JVM
  - **JDK**:
    - Java Development Kit aka JDK
    - Provides all the tools, executables, and binaries required to compile, debug, and execute a Java Program.
    - JDK is a platform-specific software and that’s why we have separate installers for Windows, Mac, and Unix systems.
    - JDK is the superset of JRE since it contains JRE with Java compiler, debugger, and core classes.
  
  - **JRE**:
    - JRE is the implementation of JVM.
    - Provides a platform to execute java programs.
    - JRE consists of JVM, Java binaries, and other classes to execute any program successfully.
    - JRE doesn’t contain any development tools such as Java compiler, debugger, JShell, etc.
    - If you just want to execute a java program, you can install only JRE. You don’t need JDK because there is no development or compilation of java source code is required.
  
  - **JVM**:
    - When we execute a Java program, JVM is responsible for converting the byte code to the machine-specific code.
    - JVM is also platform-dependent
    - Provides core java functions such as memory management, garbage collection, security, etc.
    - JVM is customizable and we can use java options to customize it. For example, allocating minimum and maximum memory to JVM.
    - JVM is called virtual because it provides an interface that does not depend on the underlying operating system and machine hardware. This independence from hardware and the operating system makes java program write-once-run-anywhere.

#### ✅ Some popular openJDK
  - **Adoptium Eclipse Temurin**: Adoptium Eclipse Temurin OpenJDK builds are highly recommended.
  - **Amazon Corretto**: Corretto builds are a good choice, particularly if you run Java applications directly on Amazon Linux 2 in AWS.
  - **Azul Zulu**: Azul Zulu Builds of OpenJDK are a good choice.
  - **BellSoft Liberica JDK**: BellSoft Liberica JDK builds are a good choice. The popular Spring Boot framework chose Liberica JDK as runtime for their buildpack.
  - **Microsoft Build of OpenJDK**: Use Microsoft Build of OpenJDK, only if you run Java applications directly on Azure. There are more established options available.


#### ✅ What's the difference between thread and process?
A process is a self contained execution environment and it can be seen as a program or application whereas Thread is a single task of execution within the process. Java runtime environment runs as a single process which contains different classes and programs as processes. Thread can be called lightweight process. Thread requires less resources to create and exists in the process, thread shares the process resources.

#### ✅ What are the two ways of implementing thread in Java?
  - Extending the Thread class
  - Implementing Runnable interface in Java


#### ✅ User thread vs Daemon Thread
  - **User thread**
    - Exucute forground logic of application
    - These threads are normally created by the user for executing tasks concurrently. 	
    - JVM waits for user threads to finish their tasks before termination. 	
  - **Daemon Thread**
    - Invisible, hidden, service, support thread
    - Created by JVM to provides service to user thread
    - When all user thread execution ends, JVM forcefully stops all daemon thread
    - We can create daemon threads in java using the thread class **setDaemon(true)**. **isDaemon()** method is generally used to check whether the current thread is daemon or not.
    - But one can only call the setDaemon() method before start() method otherwise it will definitely throw IllegalThreadStateException.

#### ✅ What is Executors Framework?
  - Also called **multi-threading** framework
  - Creation of thread requires resource allocation and free up the resource when done. Which is costly.
  - Executors Framework creates a pool of threads and reuse those threads.
  - If a thread is done, it doesn't terminate the thread. Put it back to threadpool.
  - Types of Executor
    - **SingleThreadExecutor**: One threaded. Task are served ony by one.
    - **FixedThreadPool(n)**: Creates n threads at the beginingand reuse them
    - **CachedThreadPool**: Create threads on demand. If no threads is available, creates a new one and put the thread in pool when done for reuse.
    - **ScheduledExecutor**: Used when we have a task that needs to be run at regular intervals or if we wish to delay a certain task.


#### ✅ What’s the difference between class lock and object lock?

#### ✅ What are the wait() and sleep() methods?

#### ✅ What is atomic operation? What are atomic classes in Java Concurrency API?
#### ✅ What is BlockingQueue? How can we implement Producer-Consumer problem using Blocking Queue?
#### ✅ What is Callable and Future?
