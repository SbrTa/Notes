# Design Pattern
Design patterns are the best, formalized practices a programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

Reusing design patterns help prevent subtle issues that cause major problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.

Design patterns are divided into three categories:
  - Creational
  - Structural
  - Behavioral

### Creational Design Pattern

Creational design patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects. These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class (i.e. creating an object of a class).
  - Factory Pattern
  - Abstract Factory Pattern
  - Builder Pattern
  - Prototype Pattern
  - Singleton Pattern

### Structural Design Pattern

Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures. The structural design patterns simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships. These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other classes.
  - Adapter Pattern
  - Bridge Pattern
  - Composite Pattern
  - Decorator Pattern
  - Facade Pattern
  - Flyweight Pattern
  - Proxy Pattern

### Behavioral Design Pattern

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects. In these design patterns, the interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled. That means the implementation and the client should be loosely coupled in order to avoid hard coding and dependencies.
  - Command Pattern
  - Interpreter Pattern
  - Iterator Pattern
  - Mediator Pattern
  - Memento Pattern
  - Observer Pattern
  - State Pattern
  - Strategy Pattern
  - Template Pattern
  - Visitor Pattern
  - Null Object
