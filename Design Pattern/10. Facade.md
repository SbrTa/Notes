# Facade Design Pattern
The Facade design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem of classes, making it 
easier to use and understand. It acts as a higher-level interface that encapsulates and coordinates interactions between multiple 
classes, presenting a unified and simplified interface to clients.

```
// Complex subsystem classes
class Inventory {
    public boolean isAvailable(String productId) {
        // Check if the product is in stock
        return true;
    }
}

class Pricing {
    public double calculatePrice(String productId) {
        // Calculate the price of the product
        return 100.0;
    }
}

class PaymentProcessor {
    public boolean processPayment(double amount) {
        // Process the payment
        return true;
    }
}

// Facade class
class OnlineShoppingFacade {
    private Inventory inventory;
    private Pricing pricing;
    private PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor;

    public OnlineShoppingFacade() {
        inventory = new Inventory();
        pricing = new Pricing();
        paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor();
    }

    public boolean buyProduct(String productId) {
        if (inventory.isAvailable(productId)) {
            double price = pricing.calculatePrice(productId);
            if (paymentProcessor.processPayment(price)) {
                System.out.println("Product purchased successfully.");
                return true;
            } else {
                System.out.println("Payment failed.");
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("Product not available.");
        }
        return false;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OnlineShoppingFacade shoppingFacade = new OnlineShoppingFacade();
        shoppingFacade.buyProduct("123"); // Simulating a product purchase
    }
}
```

In this example, the OnlineShoppingFacade provides a simplified interface for buying a product. The client doesn't need to interact with 
the inventory, pricing, and payment subsystems directly. The facade coordinates the interactions and presents a unified interface to the client.
