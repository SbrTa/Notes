# Composite Design Pattern
The Composite design pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
This pattern allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It's particularly useful when dealing with hierarchical 
structures where you need to work with individual objects and their compositions interchangeably.

```
    // Component interface
    interface Graphic {
        void draw();
    }
    
    // Leaf class (individual shapes)
    class Circle implements Graphic {
        public void draw() {
            // Draw a circle
        }
    }
    
    class Square implements Graphic {
        public void draw() {
            // Draw a square
        }
    }
    
    // Composite class (group of shapes)
    class CompositeGraphic implements Graphic {
        private List<Graphic> graphics = new ArrayList<>();
    
        public void add(Graphic graphic) {
            graphics.add(graphic);
        }
    
        public void draw() {
            for (Graphic graphic : graphics) {
                graphic.draw();
            }
        }
    }
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Circle circle = new Circle();
            Square square = new Square();
    
            CompositeGraphic group = new CompositeGraphic();
            group.add(circle);
            group.add(square);
    
            group.draw(); // Draws both the circle and the square
        }
    }
```
