# Bridge Design Pattern
Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction
and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other. It aims to decouple abstraction from implementation. It's used to separate abstraction 
and implementation into separate class hierarchies, allowing them to evolve independently. These two hierarchies are connected using composition.

```
    // Implementation interface
    interface DrawingAPI {
        void drawCircle(double x, double y, double radius);
    }
    
    // Concrete implementations
    class DrawingAPI1 implements DrawingAPI {
        public void drawCircle(double x, double y, double radius) {
            // Use API1 to draw a circle
        }
    }
    
    class DrawingAPI2 implements DrawingAPI {
        public void drawCircle(double x, double y, double radius) {
            // Use API2 to draw a circle
        }
    }
    
    // Abstraction
    abstract class Shape {
        protected DrawingAPI drawingAPI;
    
        protected Shape(DrawingAPI drawingAPI) {
            this.drawingAPI = drawingAPI;
        }
    
        abstract void draw();
    }
    
    // Refined Abstraction
    class CircleShape extends Shape {
        private double x, y, radius;
    
        public CircleShape(double x, double y, double radius, DrawingAPI drawingAPI) {
            super(drawingAPI);
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
            this.radius = radius;
        }
    
        @Override
        void draw() {
            drawingAPI.drawCircle(x, y, radius);
        }
    }
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            DrawingAPI api1 = new DrawingAPI1();
            DrawingAPI api2 = new DrawingAPI2();
    
            Shape circle1 = new CircleShape(1, 2, 3, api1);
            Shape circle2 = new CircleShape(5, 7, 11, api2);
    
            circle1.draw(); // Uses DrawingAPI1
            circle2.draw(); // Uses DrawingAPI2
        }
    }

In this example, the Bridge pattern allows the shapes and rendering methods to vary independently. You can add new shapes or rendering methods without changing the existing classes. This flexibility and separation of concerns are the main benefits of the Bridge pattern.
