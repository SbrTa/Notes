# Adapter (aka - Wrapper / Translator)

## Adapter Design Pattern:
The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It involves creating a wrapper 
class (the adapter) that converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. This way, two classes that otherwise couldn't 
work together due to incompatible interfaces can communicate seamlessly.

## When to Use the Adapter Pattern:
  - Legacy Integration: You want to integrate new code/components with existing legacy code that uses a different interface.
  - Reusability: You have existing classes with useful functionality, and you want to reuse them without altering their source code.
  - Multiple Interfaces: You want to make a single class compatible with multiple interfaces or APIs.
  - Third-party Libraries: You're using a third-party library with an interface that doesn't quite match your application's needs.

## Variation
Both class adapters and object adapters are variations of the Adapter design pattern and serve the same purpose: to make two incompatible interfaces work together. However, they achieve this in slightly different ways. Let's explore the differences between class adapters and object adapters:

### Class Adapter:
In the class adapter approach, the adapter class inherits both from the existing class (the one you want to adapt) and the target interface (the one you want to make the existing class compatible with). This means that the adapter class becomes a subclass of the existing class and simultaneously implements the target interface.

#### Advantages:
  - Adapts both interface and implementation.
  - No need to reimplement all methods of the existing class.
  - Can override and provide custom implementations for specific methods if needed.

#### Disadvantages:
  - It's Java-specific since Java doesn't support multiple inheritance (a class can't extend multiple classes).
  - The existing class must be either abstract or have a suitable constructor for adaptation.
  - Tightly couples the adapter to the existing class.

### Object Adapter:
In the object adapter approach, the adapter class contains an instance of the existing class (the one you want to adapt) and implements the target interface. This means that the adapter class is composed of the existing class as a member and provides methods that delegate the calls to the appropriate methods of the existing class.

#### Advantages:
  - Adapts the interface, not the implementation.
  - Allows adapting classes that can't be subclassed (e.g., final classes).
  - Offers more flexibility since you can switch the existing class being adapted easily.
  - Avoids tight coupling between the adapter and the existing class.

#### Disadvantages:
  - Requires creating additional instances, which could impact memory and performance, though the impact is usually negligible.
  - If the existing class has many methods, the adapter class might need to delegate a lot of methods, leading to boilerplate code.

## Which One to Choose:
The choice between class adapter and object adapter depends on your specific requirements and constraints:
  - If you need to adapt both the interface and certain behavior of the existing class, and you can work with multiple inheritance, the class adapter might be a good choice.
  - If you want to adapt the interface only and prefer to avoid multiple inheritance or adapt classes that can't be subclassed, the object adapter is often more suitable.
