# Builder Design Pattern
Build complex objects step by step, making it easy to create different variations of the object while keeping things organized.

## Plot
Imagine you're building a house with different parts like walls, a roof, doors, and windows. The Builder design pattern is like having a handy instruction manual (the builder) 
that guides you step by step to put all these parts together in a specific way.

Instead of trying to remember all the details yourself, the builder helps you create the house by breaking down the process into manageable steps. You follow the instructions 
in the manual to add walls, put on the roof, install doors and windows, and so on. This way, you can build houses of different styles and sizes using the same instruction manual, 
just by following the steps and choosing the appropriate options along the way.

In programming, the Builder design pattern works similarly. It's used to create complex objects step by step, allowing you to construct different variations of an object while 
keeping the construction process organized and easy to follow. Just like the house-building example, the Builder pattern helps avoid having to remember all the details of object 
creation and configuration, making your code more maintainable and flexible.
