# Prototype
Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you **copy existing objects** without making your code dependent on their classes.

## Problem
Say you have an object, and you want to create an exact copy of it. How would you do it? First, you have to create a new object of the same class. 
Then you have to go through all the fields of the original object and copy their values over to the new object.

Nice! But there’s a catch. Not all objects can be copied that way because some of the object’s fields may be private and not visible from outside 
of the object itself.

There’s one more problem with the direct approach. Since you have to know the object’s class to create a duplicate, your code becomes dependent on 
that class. If the extra dependency doesn’t scare you, there’s another catch. Sometimes you only know the interface that the object follows, but not 
its concrete class, when, for example, a parameter in a method accepts any objects that follow some interface.


## Solution

The Prototype pattern delegates the cloning process to the actual objects that are being cloned. The pattern declares a common interface for all objects 
that support cloning. This interface lets you clone an object without coupling your code to the class of that object. Usually, such an interface contains 
just a single **clone** method.

The implementation of the **clone** method is very similar in all classes. The method creates an object of the current class and carries over all of the field 
values of the old object into the new one. You can even copy private fields because most programming languages let objects access private fields of other 
objects that belong to the same class.

An object that supports cloning is called a **prototype**. When your objects have dozens of fields and hundreds of possible configurations, cloning them might 
serve as an alternative to subclassing.


## Pros of Prototype Design Pattern:
 - Efficient Object Creation: Cloning reduces resource-heavy object creation.
 - Dynamic Customization: Create objects at runtime with different configurations.
 - Variability without Subclasses: Customize prototypes instead of making many subclasses. 
 - Isolated Creation Logic: Keep object creation logic within prototypes.
 - Alternative to inheritance when dealing with configuration presets for complex objects.


## Cons of Prototype Design Pattern:
 - Cloning Complexity: Cloning nested objects can be complex.
 - State Challenges: Mutable state in prototypes might lead to issues.
 - Initialization Needed: Cloned objects might need extra setup.
 - Prototype Management: Handling a collection of prototypes can be hard.
 - Resource Intensiveness: Complex prototypes can still use many resources.
 - Type Checking Not Straightforward: Cloning might not match traditional object creation.
 - Non-Serializable Issues: Cloning non-serializable objects can be problematic.
