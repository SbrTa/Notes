# Proxy Design Pattern
The Proxy design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control its access. It acts as an 
intermediary between a client and a target object, allowing the proxy to add extra functionality or control the access to the target object.

### Key Components:
  - Subject: This is the common interface or abstract class shared by the proxy and the real subject. It defines the methods that both the proxy and
    the real subject must implement.
  - Real Subject: This is the actual object that the proxy represents. It implements the Subject interface and contains the actual business logic.
  - Proxy: This is an object that implements the Subject interface and controls access to the real subject. It can perform additional tasks before or
    after forwarding calls to the real subject.

### When to Use the Proxy Pattern:
  - You want to add extra functionality: If you need to perform additional tasks before or after accessing the real subject, a proxy can provide this functionality.
  - You want to control access: When you want to control the access to the real subject, a proxy can enforce security checks or access control mechanisms.
  - You want to delay object creation: If creating the real subject is resource-intensive, a proxy can defer its creation until it's actually needed.

    // Subject interface
    interface ATM {
        void withdrawMoney(int amount);
    }
    
    // Real subject
    class RealATM implements ATM {
        private int accountBalance;
    
        public RealATM(int initialBalance) {
            this.accountBalance = initialBalance;
        }
    
        public void withdrawMoney(int amount) {
            if (accountBalance >= amount) {
                accountBalance -= amount;
                System.out.println("Withdrawal successful. Remaining balance: " + accountBalance);
            } else {
                System.out.println("Insufficient funds.");
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Proxy
    class ProxyATM implements ATM {
        private RealATM realATM;
        private int accountBalance;
    
        public ProxyATM(int initialBalance) {
            this.accountBalance = initialBalance;
        }
    
        private void connectToRealATM() {
            if (realATM == null) {
                realATM = new RealATM(accountBalance);
            }
        }
    
        public void withdrawMoney(int amount) {
            connectToRealATM();
            realATM.withdrawMoney(amount);
        }
    }
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            ATM proxyATM = new ProxyATM(1000);
    
            proxyATM.withdrawMoney(500); // Successful withdrawal
            proxyATM.withdrawMoney(800); // Insufficient funds
        }
    }
```
