# Simple Storage Service (S3)
  - Object based storage
  - Can store any type of file
  - Only static file
  - Can not be used to install OS or DB
  - Unlimited storage
  - Max individual object size upto 5TB
  - Stores file in bucket
  - Universal namespace. That is, S3 bucket name is globally unique
  - S3 object
    ```
      key: name of the object
      value: actual data
      version id: version of the object
      metadata: ie - content type, last modified etc.
    ```
  - Build for 99.95%-99.99% availibility
  - Designed for 99.999999999% (11 nine) durability
  - Strong Read-After-Write consistency
  - Generates HTTP 200 status code for successful write 
  - S3 can host static content (not dynamic)
  - S3 scales automatially with demand

## 1. S3 storage classes

#### 1.1 S3 Standard
- Default and suitable for most workloads
- 99.99% availability
- 99.999999999% durability
- Designed for frequently accessed data
- Stores data in a minimum of three Availability Zones
- Most expensive
- good for websites, content distribution, mobile application, gaming application, and data analytics

#### 1.2 S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
  - Ideal for infrequently accessed but requires high availability
  - lower storage price and higher retrieval price
  - store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones

#### 1.3 S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
  - Stores data in a single Availability Zone
  - lower price than S3 Standard-IA
  - The only single zone S3 storage class

#### 1.4 S3 Intelligent-Tiering
  - Ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns
  - Requires a small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object
  - object that havenâ€™t accessed for 30 consecutive days, automatically moves it to the S3 Standard-IA
  - Most frequently accessed objects moves to S3 Standard

## 2 S3 Glacier
  - Data archive
  - Low-cost
  - retrieve objects within a few minutes to hours
  - you pay each time you access your data
  - 99.99% availability
  - 11 nine durability
  - >=3 zone

#### 2.1 Glacier Options
  - S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval (Default)
    - Instant retrieval
    - Milliseconds retrieval time
  - S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
    - Great for data that does not require immediate access
    - Retrieve large dataset with no cost
    - Retrieval time can be minutes or up to 12 hours
    - Backup or disaster recovery use case
  - S3 Deep Archive
    - Cheepest storage class
    - Standard retrieval time is 12 hours and bulk retrieval time is 48 hours
    - Great for customers that retain data sets for 7-10 years


## 3. S3 versioning
  - S3 suports versioning
  - Greate for backup
  - Stores multiple version of same object
  - Disabled by default
  - Once enalbled, you can't disable it
  - But versioning can be suspended
  - Versioning can be integrated with lifecycle rules
  - Use MFA to prevent accidental delete all version of an object
  - If bucket is public, then object will be accessible publicly
  - But when a new version uploaded, the new version is set public, but previous version is set private automatically.
  - So, you have to make the previous version public manually
  - If you delete an version, it will set a delete flag. Not permanenetly delete the object.
  - And deleting the delete marker, makes the object accessible again
  
## 4. Security
  - Server side encryption
  - Access Control List (ACL)
  - Bucket policies

#### 4.1 ACL vs Bucket policies
  - ACL works on indivudual object level
  - You can make an individual object public using ACL
  - Bucket policies work on entire bucket
  - You can make an entire bucket public using bucket policies
